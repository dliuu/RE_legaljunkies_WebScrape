								UPSIDE DOWN ON YOUR PROPERTY?  PAYMENTS UNAFFORDABLE?  TURNED DOWN ON A MODIFICATION?   BANK THREATENING TO FORECLOSE? <br/>
<br/>
If any of these financial nightmares describes your situation, you are in company with at least 60 million homeowners in America today.  The rapid deflation  of house values, coupled with exotic  mortgages written  during the real estate bubble have put millions of homeowners in dire financial straits as they see all the money and toil they put into their homes vanish and they now owe far more than it their home is worth.  The monthly payments under those low interest  ARM’s in many cases  doubled and families are faced with putting food on the table or paying the bank for the roof over their heads.  If one has also lost their job due to the weakened economy or had their hours and pay cut, the situation appears hopeless.   Every 90 seconds in some courts people are losing their homes to foreclosure and facing the prospect of the sheriff putting them out on the street.  “Rocket dockets” they are called, judges signing foreclosure decrees as rapidly as they can put their signature to the order.  The American Dream of home ownership has become the worst of nightmares for millions of families – over 5 million homes lost to foreclosure since 2008.  And millions more in the pipeline.  <br/>
<br/>
Some smart people however are lodging a defense and turning the tables on their banks – in some cases living payment- free for up to five years and/or getting their homes free and clear of their  onerous mortgage.<br/>
<br/>
How can that happen?  What magic wand do they wave to get a judge to decree “this mortgage is VOID!?”<br/>
<br/>
What follows is a brief history of how many mortgages were made the past nine years,  how people were led (or duped) into mortgages they could not afford to carry to term,  and the paths to fighting the banks --  and winning!   <br/>
<br/>
Beginning in 2002, with many bank regulations stripped from the law books  and encouraged by federal policy to make home ownership available to as many as possible, banks and mortgage lenders came up with exotic mortgage plans, dispensing with historical prudent rules on qualifying people and properties for loans.  “Pick a payment” and others where the individual wasn’t paying even the accruing interest,  110%, 125% of the value loans,  “stated income” [no proof of ability to repay],  debt ratios as high as 40% and upwards when prudent standards say one should pay no more than 28% -30% of their income for housing expense, “80/20” loans where the seller falsely credits the buyer with 20% down payment, are just some of the Mickey Mouse loans that were concocted for buyers – destining them for nothing but financial disaster down the road.  <br/>
<br/>
When loans were written with payments calculated at 4.75% interest or similar rate, the lender knew within short order the interest would escalate to 8% or more and the person be unable to pay.  “Refinance then” was their cavalier philosophy.  Well, the real estate bubble burst, values declined, unemployment soared – banks had to be bailed out for bad paper they wrote and refinancing just wasn’t available—especially after a person had missed a payment or two and the house was now worth less than he paid for it – worth even less than he owed.<br/>
<br/>
The mortgage business was the golden road to easy riches, banks even offering bonuses to officers for volume.   In the haste to get as many mortgages written as possible and then sell them to investors before even the ink was dry, a few laws were broken along the way.  TILA (Truth in Lending), RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act), HOEPA, (Home Owners Equal Protection Act), in some cases Discrimination  [Civil Rights Act), and, of course, predatory [loan shark] lending, plus violations of the various states’ consumer protection and fraud laws were part and parcel of as many as 90% of some banks and mortgage companies loans.     Further, the federal government has estimated that in at least 60% of mortgages  the bank is stealing from the homeowner for miscalculations of payments was common – in favor of the bank, of course. <br/>
<br/>
Some lenders were more notorious than others , notably Countrywide. All the major banks; Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, Citibank have portfolios full of loans where federal and state laws were violated in the mortgages they wrote from 2002 on.  All 50 states attorneys  general are investigating to bring charges against these and other lenders who ripped off their citizens with fraudulent and predatory loans over the past 9 years. <br/>
<br/>
To further muck the issue was the way these loans were sold.  With such tremendous volume, selling these mortgages and transferring paper was cumbersome.  So an electronic system to transfer and record mortgages, MERS , was born.  Mortgages were sold sometimes over and over without the paperwork following to the new investor/owner.  The all important note and mortgage may have remained with the original closing office – or not.  Or was destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the major banks called a brief moratorium on foreclosures earlier this year.  The reason was that foreclosure law firms they hired were discovered to be regularly presenting bogus documents, forged signatures in court to convince the court they owned the note and mortgage and as legal owner had the right to foreclose.  Forgery and perjury were rampant in foreclosure proceedings and if the homeowner was not represented by a lawyer, the hearing he is given may last as long as 90 seconds. <br/>
<br/>
HOW these mortgages were made, the violations of federal statutes like TILA, RESPA, HOEPA as well as predation and common law fraud has been the key to defending against the bank, attacking the validity of the mortgage, the illegality of how it was made – and opens the door to having a court declare it invalid.  <br/>
<br/>
When they cannot produce the note and mortgage, per a landmark decision obtained  by attorney Glen Russell, the Massachusetts Supreme Court decreed the lender may not foreclose or even collect on the mortgage.  The homeowners got their property free and clear.  Other jurisdictions are following this ruling and precedent.   Thanks to the shortcuts lenders took via MERS, many lenders cannot produce the critical documents – evidence they own the note and mortgage – or that one was even made.   That is the reason for the rampant forgery and fraudulent documents foreclosure mills have been generating. <br/>
<br/>
When financial audits have been performed and it is disclosed that the bank has been collecting too much from the homeowner, a refund can be obtained.  In one case, a $35 overcharge was enough for the court to declare the mortgage void and award the house to the homeowner free and clear. In another, the homeowner got a $30,000 refund.<br/>
<br/>
When the bank is aware the homeowner and his lawyer have done their homework, know they do not have the proper documents and have found the proofs of federal and state law violations, they are amenable to restructuring the loan – reducing principal and/or interest to the homeowner’s satisfaction.  For if they go to court, the bank risks losing the entire mortgage. <br/>
<br/>
Next will be a discussion on modifications – the reasons why not to trust your bank – the disadvantages of a modification vs. restructuring the loan.

								Re: DEFENSES TO MORTGAGES<br/>
<br/>
I read your remarks and have a similar situation.<br/>
I live in Jamaica, (Jamaica is based on English Law), I am in arrears with my mortgage on my apartment,<br/>
the mortgage company has put my apartment up for auction or private treaty sale.  I made an 'Official Offer'<br/>
to repay debt, I made the first payment and received an official receipt from the mortgage company.  Never the less, the mortgage company is not accepting my offer and are going ahead with the auction.  <br/>
Question, The fact that I made an official offer, made the promised payment and have an official receipt from<br/>
the mortgage company; Does this constitute an enforceable new binding contract, and the mortgage company would not be able to exercise their 'Power of Sale' option as long as I continue making payments<br/>
as promised?  Looking forward to your opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

								Lawyers David Ramba and Philip Kramer file mass actions on behalf of homeowners challenging the terms of their mortgages. The lawyers have filed six suits on behalf of about 6,000 combined homeowners. But the suits are unique in that the plaintiffs must pay $5,000 up front to join the litigation, the Times reports.<br/>

In class actions, lawyers typically charge clients nothing up front, but the lawyers are entitled to earn up to one-third (or more)  of any recoveries. <br/>

Some question the value of the mortgage-relief suits brought by Ramba and Kramer, according to the Times, noting that critics contend that already beleaguered homeowners could be further victimized by having to pay up-front fees without ultimately winning relief from the terms of their home loans.<br/>

								QUESTION: What type of attorney should I look for? What are some tips to use to find such and attorney? (i.e. search terms, organizations, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
=====================<br/>
I need to consult with an attorney that has direct experience representing a client about to go into and during foreclosure. I'd like to find out what options are available to me during that process. I don't want to just hire some real estate attorney who does closings for a living or one who will have to learn from scratch on my dime.<br/>
<br/>
The property has a defective title and the bank has a title insurance policy. I'd like to attempt to guide the process to repossession of the property, not write off and 1099 issuance. I need to 'encourage' the bank to take the property and use their insurance policy to clear the title.<br/>
<br/>
I need this monkey (property and mortgage) off my back and a 1099 would likely wipe me out.<br/>

QUESTION: What type of attorney should I look for? What are some tips to use to find such and attorney? (i.e. search terms, organizations, etc.) <br/>
<br/>
Note: I contacted the Gaston county clerk of courts and asked about searching past cases to attempt to find attorneys experienced in certain areas but was told there wasn't way to search the court records. I'm still flabbergasted that this may be the case. If true then the average citizen is blind here. Also if true how can attorneys search for presedence?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
==================================================  ==<br/>
I have dealt with three attorneys on this issue from other perspectives (not foreclosure):<br/>
- The first was a knowledgeable attorney but would not work further than educate me; he would not work for me because the property is in another county from him.<br/>
- The above attorney directed me to a firm that supposedly had experience; they claimed they did but it turned out the assigned attorney did not have experience and he decided to work other issues (still took the retainer balance with him).<br/>
- The third attorney admitted he only knew of the topic from his college days (likely 1970/1980s). He wanted $450 and hour and a retainer of $5000 to learn as he went.​

								There are a few ways to verify an attorney's claimed experience in litigating a specific legal matter. Here are some suggestions:<ol class=""decimal""><li>Check the attorney's website or online profile: Many attorneys have websites or profiles on legal directories where they list their areas of practice and experience. Look for examples of cases they have handled that are similar to yours, and see if they provide any specific details about those cases.</li>
<li>Ask for references: Ask the attorney for references from clients they have represented in similar cases. Contact these clients to ask about their experience with the attorney and whether they feel the attorney had the necessary experience to handle their case.</li>
<li>Check court records: You can search online court records to see if the attorney has actually handled cases similar to yours in the past. Look for cases that were litigated, as opposed to settled out of court, as these will provide more information about the attorney's experience in the courtroom.</li>
<li>Ask other attorneys: If you know other attorneys who practice in the same area of law, you can ask them if they know the attorney in question and if they have any knowledge of their experience.</li>
<li>Ask the attorney directly: Finally, you can simply ask the attorney to provide more details about their experience and to explain how they are qualified to handle your case. If they are reputable and truly experienced in the area, they should be happy to provide this information.</li>

<li>Ask for references: Ask the attorney for references from clients they have represented in similar cases. Contact these clients to ask about their experience with the attorney and whether they feel the attorney had the necessary experience to handle their case.</li>
<li>Check court records: You can search online court records to see if the attorney has actually handled cases similar to yours in the past. Look for cases that were litigated, as opposed to settled out of court, as these will provide more information about the attorney's experience in the courtroom.</li>
<li>Ask other attorneys: If you know other attorneys who practice in the same area of law, you can ask them if they know the attorney in question and if they have any knowledge of their experience.</li>
<li>Ask the attorney directly: Finally, you can simply ask the attorney to provide more details about their experience and to explain how they are qualified to handle your case. If they are reputable and truly experienced in the area, they should be happy to provide this information.</li>
</ol>​

First of all, there is no distinction between co-borrower and main borrower. You are both equal owners of the home and equal debtors on the loan.<br/>
<br/>
So, no, he cannot evict you for being unwilling or unable to refinance. If he goes to court with that, he will fail.<br/>
<br/>
However, what he can do is file a partition action in court which would end up having the court force the sale of the home and splitting the proceeds between you.<br/>

I've seen posts where lenders leave defaulted loans on the books for years. I've seen posts where lenders write off the loan and send a 1099 to the borrower so the borrower has to pay taxes on the forgiven amount.<br/>

</div>
</div>That's easy. There's no law preventing it.<br/>
<br/>
Foreclosure is a process that can be instituted against a borrower any time there is an alleged breach of the loan contract. The lender will name the borrowers and anybody who has any interest in the property, known or unknown. Whether or not they have good or bad title is irrelevant because the lender wins when the court extinguishes all other interests, known or unknown, and awards the property to the lender, free of any encumbrances.<br/>
<br/>
As with any litigation, defendants to foreclosure can raise defenses. You'll have to explain why the title is defective if you want an opinion as to whether defective title is an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Also explain what you want to accomplish and what state the property is located in.<br/>
<br/>
Or, you can just look up your state's foreclosure statute and read the whole thing.

In most cases, you can sue in the state where the property is located.  Usually you serve the ""registered agent"" you can get that from the secretary of state website most of the time.  Unless your loan paperwork states that ""the hq state is the only venue"" - but I doubt that.  Good luck

								I hope everyone is safe and healthy.<br/>
<br/>
I am reviewing public notices in the local commerce rag and had a question about Trustee Sales of real estate in Seattle.  <br/>
<br/>
RCW 61.24.040 has some language: The above-described real property will be sold to satisfy the expense of sale and the obligation secured by the Deed of Trust as provided by statute. <br/>
<br/>
As a naive person should I assume that the intention of the public auction for trustee sales to have a minimum bid to cover all outstanding ""obligations"" as noted in the RCW?  Or is there a magical workflow where those obiligations are simply not paid?  Meaning the minimum and perhaps winning bid is really low and one could walk away from the auction feeling really good?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.

I wish to inform you that RCW 61.24.040 provides how the proceeds will be distributed. Intention of the regulation is to cover cost of sale along with recovery of amount due. Sale in case of public auction is generally to highest bidder so that maximum amount may be recovered. <br/>

One might still make the winning bid and walk away feeling good if one got the property at a below-market price.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What usually happens is that, by the time it gets to a trustee sale, the property is worth less than what is owed on it. If there was any equity in it the defaulter would have been able to sell it to pay off the loan before it went to foreclosure.

</div>the only way you can collect rent is if you are stillhte legal owner and not in foreclosure status!<br/>
if you collect rent on a foreclosure you can be sued for  damages  by the family who lives there!<br/>
 when you g o into foreclosure you must let yo7ur residents know that so htat they may prepare to move and not waste time..im sure they have a life that does not rule around yours!

								Re: Can I collect rent while my house is in default?<br/>
<br/>
I am a tenant who lives in a condo that is headed towards foreclosure...I think it is horrible that my landlord is still collecting rent from me when they are not even making payments on the condo. Why should they get to pocket my rent payments when I will just get evicted in the end?<br/>
<br/>
So my question is...what is considered foreclosure status? Can I do anything? A letter arrived stating that the house was in default, and if payments were not made, then the bank would foreclose on the house. Do I still have to continue to pay my landlord rent when they have not paid their mortgage payments over the past year? The letter stated that they had not paid over $18,000 in mortgage payments. <br/>
<br/>
Please help!

<br/>
The payment status of the owner does not remove your need to pay rent.
							
						</div>, <div class=""js-post__content-text restore h-wordwrap"" itemprop=""text"">
							
								
								Re: Can I collect rent while my house is in default?<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to continue to collect rent, why not use the money to pay the bank what you owe instead of letting it go to foreclosure? <br/>
<br/>
Are you aware of the repercussions of having a foreclosure? Why would anyone simply ""let"" their property go to foreclosure? <br/>
<br/>
In addition, many states require a landlord to have a Certificate of Occupancy. If you do not have this, you are renting illegally and cannot enforce payment from your tenant. You especially cannot keep the tenant's security deposit. <br/>
<br/>
To July 18th's question: How did you come to be in possession of your landlord's mail? Surely a foreclosure notice does not go to the tenants. It goes to the mortgagee. <br/>
<br/>
Again, if your landlord is legal, and can, in fact, rent out to tenants, his foreclosure status has nothing to do with your agreement to pay your rent on time. One does not cancel out the other.

								Re: Can I collect rent while my house is in default?<br/>
<br/>
In the State of California, a landlord who collects any amount of rent from a tenant with the intention of not paying their mortgage obligation to a lender first, is in violation of the civil code that listed below... it is defined as skimming! Your Landlord may go to jail for intentionally defrauding his mortgage lender.<br/>
<br/>
California Civil Code 890.  (a) (1) ""Rent skimming"" means using revenue received from the<br/>
rental of a parcel of residential real property at any time during<br/>
the first year period after acquiring that property without first<br/>
applying the revenue or an equivalent amount to the payments due on<br/>
all mortgages and deeds of trust encumbering that property.<br/>
<br/>
This does not clarify the tenants rights regarding paying rent under these circumstances. i would think the landlord has the right to collect, but, if he is intentionally defrauding his lender in the process... you would need to ask a lawyer.

Well the Rent Skimming Law works only on the fact that the person purchased the home within a 1 Year time frame, so this probably rules out most people but I would write a letter to the Landlord letting them know you know the home is in the foreclosure process and that you have NOT BEEN NOTIFIED IN GOOD FAITH by the Landlord that the home is in foreclosure so could make reasonable moving arrangements that take time and money and he/she has failed to give you sufficient notice of the pending foreclosure that opens up the potential for you and your family to experience DAMAGES (stress of moving, son/daughter missing school, having to enroll them into a new school, unexpected moving expenses, higher rent, etc.). Then I would demand that the landlord provide WRITTEN PROOF that they are trying to save the home (which they most likely are not since they are scumbags that never were honest with you in good faith notifying you that the home is going into foreclosure) and if they in fact trying to save the home then sure they are entitled to the rent and if not, I would like to see them try to win an eviction case in court for a home that they are going to lose anyways and could get sued by the bank for keeping the rents they have been pocketing so far! No scumbag is going to open that can of worms once they know that you're not a push over and will fight it in court to the end!

<br/>
I'm in the same situation, landlord is in default. He failed to tell us he was doing this. He said that he had to go into default to get the new loan mod that the president signed last year. My cousin is in real estate and said that it is against the law to collect rent while in default. We discovered this default because he has been getting all his real estate mail sent to our address, making it look like he still lives here. He even asked if he could get the utilities put in his name. He claims to be fixing the problem but we don't believe him, so we are holding back the rent to save to move out. (We live in CA)<br/>
We just got 12 envelopes of mail today from his lender for him, I'm tired of getting his mail.

I don't know where some of you are getting the idea that a landlord cannot collect rent while in default of their mortgage. They can. <br/>
<br/>
To Unregistered 8:59p.m. You cannot withhold the rent for that reason. Withhold rent and face eviction.

								Re: Can I collect rent while my house is in default?<br/>
<br/>
My mom died in February.<br/>
<br/>
She had a condo in California worth $350K and a mortgage with a $500K payoff amount.<br/>
<br/>
My sister/the-executor-of-the-estate has decided to just let the bank have it as there is no cash in the estate and she and I together don't have enough income to make the $2,500-per-month mortgage payments.<br/>
<br/>
However, she has rented it out to a tenant for $1,600 per month (after informing the tenant that the property will eventually go into foreclosure).<br/>
<br/>
She wants to start sending me half of the rent money she is collecting.<br/>
<br/>
Is it legal for her to do this?  If I accept half of the rent money, am I going to get myself in trouble?

								Re: Can I collect rent while my house is in default?<br/>
<br/>
As long as the landlord is still the legal owner, meaning the foreclosure has not been completed, they can still collect rent. Withholding your rent will result in eviction. What makes you think you are entitled to stay in a property for free? Foreclosure is simply transfer of ownership. Just as if they were selling the property to someone else, you would pay rent to the original owner until the sale is COMPLETE, then you would make arrangements with the new owner to either pay them the rent or move. If you break your lease by not paying, you can get evicted &amp; lose your security deposit. Also, once a foreclosure is complete and bank has taken back possession, they will normally contact the tenant to make arrangements for the tenant to move (assuming the bank does not want to keep the lease in place - most don't). They will usually give you 90 days AND they will pay you to move out, sometimes up to a few thousand dollars. This is called ""cash for keys"". <br/>
<br/>
You have two options when your landlord is going into foreclosure:<br/>
<br/>
1. Continue paying rent as normal, wait for new owner (Bank) to contact you &amp; decide whether to stay or move at that point<br/>
2. Move out. If you don't want to pay rent you need to move out. If you have a lease in place you'll be breaking your lease and will most likely lose your security deposit. It's possible that the owner **may** cancel your lease to be nice, but probably not.

</div>Hello I am currently renting a house that we just found out that is in default, I live in  Calif.  I understand the landlord has the right to collect rent but what if there is repairs that need to be done like the plumbing we have no bathroom plumbing and the landlord refuses to fix it it will cost him 2300.00.<br/>

It is unfortunate but there is a lot of this going on.  I rented a home a few months ago and found out that the house is in foreclosure shortly after.  We asked if the house was in default or in foreclosure prior to signing a one year lease.  We were told that it was not.  We found out that there was an auction date scheduled only a month after we moved in.  Shame on us for trusting people.  We confronted our landlord about the issue and we were told that he was trying to Modify the home and that the auction dates will continue to be postponed until the modification is finalized.  So there is a new auction date monthly.  He has not provided us with written proof of the pending modification.  It has been a stressful situation for myself and my family.  He will not directly answer why we were lied to about the status of the home.  We were not given the rightful chance to decide for ourselves if we wanted to move forward with this LL.  The right thing to do was to inform us.  We want to move, but we are stuck for the time being because the cost of relocating in California is tremendous.  We continue to pay rent because he is unfortunately entitled to it until it changes hands.  There are many other issues that we have come across and are currently dealing with during our stay and I do not feel comfortable airing it.  We have spoken to a couple of Lawyers and have been told by all of them that we have a case and can sue.  He is in breach of the 1 year lease agreement and he did not disclose that the house was in foreclosure.<br/>

</div>He is not in breach of your lease simply because the house is in foreclosure.  Unless there is a state law that says so, or your written lease specifically states that the house is not in foreclosure at the time that you entered into it, and won't be for the duration of the lease, then what the LL is doing is perfectly legal and doesn't affect your lease at all.  In fact, even AFTER the house is foreclosed and transferred to a new owner, your lease transfers intact to the new owner.  The only difference at that point is that you pay your rent to a new LL instead of the old one until your lease expires normally.<br/>
<br/>
As a tenant in a potentially foreclosed property, you ALSO enjoy the protection of the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act of 2009 (PTFA), which reiterates what I've already said.  In addition, it offers additional protections - including protection from eviction by a new property owner and a guarantee of no less than 90 days notice in the event that the new owner plans to occupy the property.  This is in addition to any protections offered by your own state LL/T laws.<br/>
<br/>
For those interested in learning more about the PTFA, how it works, and finding sample letters to send to new owners/banks and LLs, see here:<br/>

								Re: Can I collect rent while my house is in default?<br/>

You are still supposed to pay according to your lease.<br/>
And legally you are required to do so. And the LL could try to collect in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose there is some question about whether the LL will enforce the obligation given the LL's own behavior currently.<br/>
You will have to judge that.

<div class=""message"">I am a tenant who lives in a condo that is headed towards foreclosure...I think it is horrible that my landlord is still collecting rent from me when they are not even making payments on the condo. Why should they get to pocket my rent payments when I will just get evicted in the end?<br/>
<br/>
So my question is...what is considered foreclosure status? Can I do anything? A letter arrived stating that the house was in default, and if payments were not made, then the bank would foreclose on the house. Do I still have to continue to pay my landlord rent when they have not paid their mortgage payments over the past year? The letter stated that they had not paid over $18,000 in mortgage payments. <br/>
<br/>
Please help!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>They are pocketing the rent money because they are the owners of the property that you are renting. I assume that you are living in the property that you are renting so I guess the real question is why should you get to live in someone else's property if you don't pay any rent. Even if the property is in default, and whether the owner has made their payments or not, is only your concern as far as it concerns your rights. Even if there is a foreclosure sale date scheduled, you still need to pay your rent to the owners for as long as they own the property if you are still living in the property and enjoying the benefit of living there. If and when the property is sold due to a foreclosure of the owner's loan, the property will be sold and the lender will collect all of the missed payments plus interest and many thousands of dollars on top of all that for numerous other charges so, you see the owner will end up paying the price in the end. Why do you feel the need to kick a person when they're down and add to their troubles? Just pay your rent. It is the right thing to do!

I wish to inform you that it is a common practice to have a witness to the mortgage document. This serves the purpose to prove the mortgage terms. In this when the documents are signed by notary public it serves the purpose as he is acting as a witness to the agreement. Hence, notary public is sufficient.<br/>

								Re: Is Witness signature required in mortgage documents by NJ law<br/>
<br/>
To correct the last poster's misinformation, a witness and a notary are two entirely different things.<br/>
<br/>
A witness is one who can attest that you signed certain documents, were in complete control of your faculties, did not sign under duress, and knew what was contained in the documents. <br/>
<br/>
A notary merely acknowledges that you personally appeared before them, you are who you say you are, and you signed a document in their presence. They are witness ONLY to your signature. Notaries are not privy to what the documents actually are, or what information they contain. They cannot ascertain whether or not you were under duress or whether you had control of your faculties. They merely witness your signature and can attest that it was actually you who signed. <br/>
<br/>
No, a witness is not required. A notary is sufficient. In fact, it's usually a notary who sits in and is involved in the signing of mortgage documents during closings.

In this when the documents are signed by notary public it serves the purpose as he is acting as a witness to the agreement. Hence, notary public is sufficient.<br/>

								Re: Is Witness signature required in mortgage documents by NJ law<br/>
<br/>
To correct the last poster's misinformation, a witness and a notary are two entirely different things.<br/>
<br/>
A witness is one who can attest that you signed certain documents, were in complete control of your faculties, did not sign under duress, and knew what was contained in the documents. <br/>
<br/>
A notary merely acknowledges that you personally appeared before them, you are who you say you are, and you signed a document in their presence. They are witness ONLY to your signature. Notaries are not privy to what the documents actually are, or what information they contain. They cannot ascertain whether or not you were under duress or whether you had control of your faculties. They merely witness your signature and can attest that it was actually you who signed. <br/>
<br/>
No, a witness is not required. A notary is sufficient. In fact, it's usually a notary who sits in and is involved in the signing of mortgage documents during closings.

								Re: Can I collect past-due rent after foreclosure?<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that last rent due may be collected by you. When ownership was transferred at that time past rent due was belonging to you and the tenant was your debtor. You may issue a notice to your tenant and can collect past rent due to you. You can claim as the tenant is your debtor for the said amount. <br/>

</div>
</div>
</div>You can collect rents that were due for the period of time you were the owner of the property. If amounts that were due during the time you owned the property have not been paid, you can still try to collect the money, because the money is owed to you.You are the owner of the property until a deed has been recorded in the proper public agency in your county in which the property is located. Until that time, you are entitled to all rent money. An exception to this is if a receiver has been appointed to collect the rents on the property prior to the foreclosure. In this case the money that is collected in rent should be applied to the money that is owed in connection to the default of the loan if the loan is in default for failing to make payments that are due.

								Dear Sirs, <br/>

I have often seen banks are putting forfeit properties on auction on "" As and where basis"". I Generally observed that initial auction price is less that market prices so selected residential properties (flat/ Appt in particular) seems interesting to me. In enquired to few of the bank where they informed that in case auction is won by me then said property with all the rights on As &amp; where basis will be sold to me and sale deed will be registered between bank and myself. <br/>
<br/>
I want all your expert advice/suggestion / clarity that:<br/>
<br/>
1. Whether it is advisable to go for such purchase of properly keeping in view that it is required for self use with ZERO legal hassle or any other problem in future. <br/>
<br/>
2. Since real owner of property is not directly involved in auction / sale deed, can the real owner of property raise any legal or other issue once I make all the payments, taken possession and started using this property. <br/>
<br/>
3. What precaution to be taken in case such option of purchase is opted to make the deal safe from legal perspectives. <br/>
<br/>
4. Will private banks and govt banks will be same from any legal angle for such proceedings or Govt bank will be safe and to be preferred.  <br/>

In an auction purchase the bank register the property to the buyer through a sale certificate and not through a sale deed. All auction purchases are not zero hassle free. It is advisable to obtain a no objection letter from the owner of the property to avoid future claims. It is good to consult a lawyer before finalizing the auction purchase.

I wish to inform you that your mother may make a Will and name your daughter as legal heir for house. As regards mortgage your mother may make an agreement with bank whereby your daughter may agree to take mortgage along with property and bank may agree to such act. Bank generally has a right for immediate repayment of loan on death thus an agreement with bank may be required to avoid foreclosure. <br/>

</div>
</div>
</div>You advise your mother that she damned well better make a will while she still has the mental competency to do it.. Otherwise, when she dies without one, her estate will go to you and any siblings you have.<br/>
<br/>
Mortgage companies generally don't foreclose upon the death of the borrower as long as the payments continue to be made.<br/>
<br/>
However, cooperation by the mortgage company will be practically non-existent because the successor owner will not be the original borrower and mortgages, for the most part, are no longer assumable in the US.<br/>
<br/>
The successor owner would have to qualify for a new mortgage on their, which might not be too difficult if there is considerable equity in the property.<br/>

</div>
</div>What the Garn-St Germaine Act does is prohibit the activation of a ""due on sale"" clause in the event of the death of a borrower and the inheriting of the property.<br/>
<br/>
The Act also provides that ""a lender is encouraged to permit an assumption of a real property loan."" Note the word ""encouraged."" That means that the lender is not required to do so.<br/>

</div>
</div>
</div>Without a will, or a trust, or her name on the deed, your daughter DOESN'T go about anything.<br/>
<br/>
You inherit the property under intestacy and you get to make the payments or qualify for a new loan. If you have no siblings you are free to deed it to your daughter and she can get a new loan as, by then, the ""due on sale"" clause might be an issue. If you have siblings you can almost bet that dividing the property among them will be an issues.<br/>
<br/>
The choices for your Mom:<br/>
<br/>
1 - Make a will naming your daughter to inherit her property and nominating either you or her as executor. The disadvantage there is that the will has to be probated for the estate to be able to sign over the property. Probate can be complicated and expensive.<br/>
<br/>
2 - A revocable living trust where the property is deeded to the trust, your daughter is beneficiary, and you the trustee and she the contingent trustee. A trust is a private contract and, by law, a simple matter to deed the property from the trust to the beneficiary. The disadvantage is that trusts often cost more money to set up properly, maybe $1000 to $2000 depending on the amount of the estate and how much is involved where wills can be drawn up by an attorney for only a few hundred. You can call around to attorneys for prices.<br/>
<br/>
3 - Deed the property from herself to herself and your daughter as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Your daughter automatically becomes the full owner at the moment of your Mom's death. No probate. Can probably get the deed form online for nothing and record it for about $20. <br/>
<br/>
Now go to the following website for all the reasons why it's a bad idea to do that:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
4 - Do nothing. Die intestate. The estate will have to go through an even more complicated and expensive probate. Relatives will come out of the woodwork for a piece of the pie.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever your Mom decides to do, she should do it NOW. Death can come at any moment and you don't get a reprieve just because you didn't do your paperwork. My younger brother died of a sudden heart attack at the age of 61. One afternoon he was out shopping with his wife, an hour later he was dead on the ground.

Wow, thanks for the valuable information. Here is some more info on my situation. My mother has no other assets other than a $10k life insurance policy to help pay her funeral expenses, her furniture, and a used vehicle.  The home has a 150k mortgage and values at about 180k. I have no siblings. Was trying to avoid my daughter applying for a mortgage as she recently graduated college, married, and had a child. Has about 35k in school loans, a car payment, a 650 fico score and only around 10k in savings. Currently they live with me. Cost for a trust or will is not an issue. I am willing to pay for the proper documentation whether its a will or trust just not sure which choice is best.

</div>
</div>That and the loan to value issue I think would make it impossible for her to qualify for a mortgage. But here's an idea. Have your daughter and her husband go to a bank and apply for a mortgage of 150k based on buying a house for 180k. They can tell the bank they are looking in the 180k price range and want to see if they qualify for a loan of 150k. Should be obvious that they don't mention Grandma's property. Right? <img alt="""" border=""0"" class=""inlineimg"" smilieid=""4"" src=""https://forum.legaljunkies.com/core/images/smilies/wink.png"" title=""Wink""/><br/>

</div>
</div>A trust is way better and for just one property I bet you can get one done for well under $1000. Call around to a couple of lawyers for prices.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what kind of financial shape you are in but if you can handle the payments on a second home with some contribution from your daughter, I think the best route is for the trust to name you as beneficiary and trustee (successor to your mother). Once your mother passes, the trust can continue to own the property, the mortgage can continue to be paid, and your daughter and her family can live in it until she can qualify for a refinance and then you can sell it to her.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage that way is that you have some control over things in case something in your daughter's life goes wrong (divorce - it happens, financial problems, etc). If she inherits, she is more likely to lose the house if something goes wrong.<br/>
<br/>
As always, discuss all this with an attorney.

One point of correction. Federal lending laws have made the original mortgage company liable to continue under the same agreement with the estate and successor owner, according to the same terms as long as all terms of the mortgage continue to be made in a timely manner. This change in law happened for the reason above, where many people inheriting a property did not have the credit to swing a refinance on short notice.

I wish to inform you that your mother may make a Will and name your daughter as legal heir for house. As regards mortgage your mother may make an agreement with bank whereby your daughter may agree to take mortgage along with property and bank may agree to such act. Bank generally has a right for immediate repayment of loan on death thus an agreement with bank may be required to avoid foreclosure. <br/>

</div>
</div>
</div>You advise your mother that she damned well better make a will while she still has the mental competency to do it.. Otherwise, when she dies without one, her estate will go to you and any siblings you have.<br/>
<br/>
Mortgage companies generally don't foreclose upon the death of the borrower as long as the payments continue to be made.<br/>
<br/>
However, cooperation by the mortgage company will be practically non-existent because the successor owner will not be the original borrower and mortgages, for the most part, are no longer assumable in the US.<br/>
<br/>
The successor owner would have to qualify for a new mortgage on their, which might not be too difficult if there is considerable equity in the property.<br/>

</div>What the Garn-St Germaine Act does is prohibit the activation of a ""due on sale"" clause in the event of the death of a borrower and the inheriting of the property.<br/>
<br/>
The Act also provides that ""a lender is encouraged to permit an assumption of a real property loan."" Note the word ""encouraged."" That means that the lender is not required to do so.<br/>

</div>
</div>Without a will, or a trust, or her name on the deed, your daughter DOESN'T go about anything.<br/>
<br/>
You inherit the property under intestacy and you get to make the payments or qualify for a new loan. If you have no siblings you are free to deed it to your daughter and she can get a new loan as, by then, the ""due on sale"" clause might be an issue. If you have siblings you can almost bet that dividing the property among them will be an issues.<br/>
<br/>
The choices for your Mom:<br/>
<br/>
1 - Make a will naming your daughter to inherit her property and nominating either you or her as executor. The disadvantage there is that the will has to be probated for the estate to be able to sign over the property. Probate can be complicated and expensive.<br/>
<br/>
2 - A revocable living trust where the property is deeded to the trust, your daughter is beneficiary, and you the trustee and she the contingent trustee. A trust is a private contract and, by law, a simple matter to deed the property from the trust to the beneficiary. The disadvantage is that trusts often cost more money to set up properly, maybe $1000 to $2000 depending on the amount of the estate and how much is involved where wills can be drawn up by an attorney for only a few hundred.

Yes, a property can be lost for taxes if they are not paid. So keep on the status of the taxes. You can have the statements mailed to you if you notify the assessor's office. Since you are a deed holder, getting the tax statements mailed to you should not be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Your post implies you have purchased another property. It appears you are asking if that second property is at risk if the jointly owned first property goes into tax foreclosure. The answer to that is, ""no."" The only property that is at risk of being foreclosed for taxes is the first property, taxes do not attach to any other property, nor is a judgment entered against the deed holder. Foreclosure for taxes for which there will later be a sale, satisfies the obligation to the state.

I wish to inform you that liability to pay taxes is that of owner. If your unpaid tax amount increases then government may sell your home and recover amount due. If still amount is not fully recovered then government may go after your and your daughter's other assets. <br/>

								I can no longer afford my house in Ohio due to hardship, specifically, I have had to go on SSDI Disability since I purchased the home with no end in sight for this situation. I only get apx $1,500/mo before expenses. I have zero assets (meaning = I’m broke). I will be able to move into a property my mom owns so I don't need to worry about a mortgage or the negative effects of a foreclosure. I qualified for a government program that has paid for my mortgage + escrow for a total of 18 months, which will end in December 2015. As of January 2016 I cannot afford to make my payments. I am not yet deficient on my mortgage (thanks to Save the Dream Ohio) but will be as of next year. I also have already had a loan modification through my mortgage company, but this still will not make payments affordable. I know if I have a short sale I will still owe the shortfall (probably at least $10,000 I would imagine). I have not yet put my home on the market nor contacted Huntington Mortgage. Will I qualify for a deed in lieu? I'm not concerned about the bad credit as I have no plans to make any purchases that will need it. Thanks for your comments!!

I wish to inform you that if you are unable to pay mortgage and if bank finds that it may sell your property and have sale price at a lesser expense then short sale or foreclosure action then it may accept deed in lieu of foreclosure. Deed in lieu of foreclosure is at will of bank and debtor and thus this agreement may result with consent of both the parties. Bank may agree in order to avoid cost of foreclosure. If bank may accept deed in lieu of foreclosure then you may require bank to provide you in terms of agreement that no deficiency judgment will be followed against you. <br/>

</div> I would approach the mortgage company to see if they will accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure.  The foreclosure process will cost them quite a bit; $7500 to the loan servicer to foreclose, after 90 days without a payment.  Then lawyer's fees to file and pursue a foreclosure suit and they conceivably could go as long as two or more years without receiving a dime.  And then, if there are tenants in the property, pay up to $7500, 'cash for keys' to get them to vacate.<br/>
<br/>
  Foreclosure is not an economical prospect for a lender.  So I would approach them to see if they will accept a deed in lieu.  Odds are in  your favor.

								I have a 20 year mortgage on my home. I financed $58,678.63 at 10.327%. My monthly payments were $579.01. It was a fixed rate conventional loan. The total finance charge was $80,278.99 for a total of $138,957.62. The first payments was Nov. 1, 1995. The loan was 239 payments of 579.01 and the last payment, due Oct. 1, 2015 is $574.23. So that's $579.01 X 239 =$138,383.39 $574.23 = $138,957.62. I haven't missed any payments, I've been late on numerous occasions but have paid all of the $28.95 late fees. I also pay an additional $45.00 to $70.00 each month to cover property taxes and Ins.I have 3 payments left and after I make those 3 it says I still owe $5800.00. How can they do this?

								My fiance has decided to let his home go into foreclosure.  He has had a lot of contact with his bank (Chase) and they basically told him to stop paying on the house in order for it to go into foreclosure.  He moved in with me and hasn't heard anything from the Chase for the last few months.  (he still goes back and forth to his house, as he still has a lot of personal property inside the residence and on the property)  then, this week he went to the house and found that the locks had been changed and a lock box was installed.  He also was able to look into the house, ( because all of the window treatments had been ripped from the windows) and saw that the house had been ransacked and some furniture had been stolen.  His John Deere tractor (valued over 25,000) had been stolen, but the keys to it had been inside the house.  When he contacted the bank, they said they had not yet filed any paperwork with the court to start foreclosure proceedings.  He then called the ""management company"" that posted the notice on the door and installed the lock box.  They informed him that he didn't have to be notified because the house appeared abandoned.  I researched the Indiana code regarding foreclosure and what constitutes abandonment,( there were several amendments to Indiana code 30-32-10.5,6, effective 2011) and I believed it to read that the creditor had to obtain a finding of abandonment from the court, and that the court would in turn notify the debtor of said finding.  It also states that there has to be sufficient attempts to notify the debtor.  Neither of these steps were taken prior to this ""seizure"".   They also will not give him the code to the lock box to retrieve his personal property, although the subcontractor hired to execute the lock change is suspected of the vandalism and theft, and he still has the code!!  What legal recourse is there for him to regain possession of the property to obtain his personal effects from the residence, and is the management company or the subcontractor liable for the theft and vandalism?

<br/>
I wish to inform you that your boyfriend can file a police complaint regarding theft of his valuables and possession by other party so that law enforcement agencies can provide your boyfriend possession of his things and home. Your boyfriend was going to his home regularly and thus he has possession as well as there is no abandonment of home. If law enforcement agencies do no provide necessary relief then your boyfriend can file a lawsuit in court and obtain court order regarding possession.  <br/>

<div class=""message"">My fiance has decided to let his home go into foreclosure. He has had a lot of contact with his bank (Chase) and they basically told him to stop paying on the house in order for it to go into foreclosure. He moved in with me and hasn't heard anything from the Chase for the last few months. (he still goes back and forth to his house, as he still has a lot of personal property inside the residence and on the property) then, this week he went to the house and found that the locks had been changed and a lock box was installed. He also was able to look into the house, ( because all of the window treatments had been ripped from the windows) and saw that the house had been ransacked and some furniture had been stolen. His John Deere tractor (valued over 25,000) had been stolen, but the keys to it had been inside the house. When he contacted the bank, they said they had not yet filed any paperwork with the court to start foreclosure proceedings. He then called the ""management company"" that posted the notice on the door and installed the lock box. They informed him that he didn't have to be notified because the house appeared abandoned. I researched the Indiana code regarding foreclosure and what constitutes abandonment,( there were several amendments to Indiana code 30-32-10.5,6, effective 2011) and I believed it to read that the creditor had to obtain a finding of abandonment from the court, and that the court would in turn notify the debtor of said finding. It also states that there has to be sufficient attempts to notify the debtor. Neither of these steps were taken prior to this ""seizure"". They also will not give him the code to the lock box to retrieve his personal property, although the subcontractor hired to execute the lock change is suspected of the vandalism and theft, and he still has the code!! What legal recourse is there for him to regain possession of the property to obtain his personal effects from the residence, and is the management company or the subcontractor liable for the theft and vandalism?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>You need to file a police report and then as long as you have i.d. like driver's license, see if you can get a locksmith to get the lockbox removed or key cut to your home.<br/>
<br/>
First impression is that the lender had no right to take possession of your home, lock you out, until a decree of foreclosure had been granted.  And it seems they also did not comply with the law re abandonment.  The subcontractor was an agent of the lender so they are resonsible for his actions. <br/>
<br/>
For the losses you have suffered you may have a claim of offset, at least, against the lender when they file their foreclosure suit.  I suggest you contact a real estate attorney experienced in foreclosure defense.

<br/>
Your fiance may have a substantial claim against the lender for entering the property prior to foreclosure decree and for the losses to his property as a result, as I stated in my previous reply.<br/>
<br/>
He should consult with a real estate lawyer that is up on recent foreclosure cases for Wells Fargo last year got socked for in excess of $100,000 in damages for entering a property prior to foreclosure which resulted in about $5K in damages to the owner's property. Your boyfriend's claim of course far exceeds that amount and he may have a substantial separate claim against the lender.

Consult with a real estate lawyer ? lol.  for what?  Have you looked at the patriot act? these are terrorist acts. has your bank been found guilty of money laundering and/or funding terrorism? That makes them actual terrorists as well..  Presidential executive orders are more relevant than real estate law!  Can the taliban do business or use our legal system to commit more crime?  think about it!

<br/>
I wish to inform you that your boyfriend can file a police complaint regarding theft of his valuables and possession by other party so that law enforcement agencies can provide your boyfriend possession of his things and home. Your boyfriend was going to his home regularly and thus he has possession as well as there is no abandonment of home. If law enforcement agencies do no provide necessary relief then your boyfriend can file a lawsuit in court and obtain court order regarding possession.  <br/>

								Re: property reclamation after foreclose<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that after the foreclosure auction you become a tenant in the property. The new owner cannot remove your personal property from the residence without your permission. You may take all your personal property while vacating the premises. If you leave property behind then the new owner could choose to store your abandoned personal property and you would become responsible for the storage bill. Once insurance claim is paid, the property paid for becomes the property of the insurance company.<br/>

Excellent suggestion FIC. Might I add, it seems the goal is not to load the truck. It is to get as much out of the house and onto the lawn as possible. After the 2 hours is up, you can load the truck. You can verify this with those involved.

To the street, is a term meaning the devil strip between sidewalk and road where anyone can pillage and the trash collector is expected, within reason to clean up on trash day. Parking helper vehicles there and the constant flow of people assisting is usually sufficient enough to stop any scrap hunters from trying to pillage until is only the actual remains after all helpers have gone.<br/>

<br/>
I wish to inform you that after the foreclosure auction you become a tenant in the property. The new owner cannot remove your personal property from the residence without your permission. You may take all your personal property while vacating the premises. If you leave property behind then the new owner could choose to store your abandoned personal property and you would become responsible for the storage bill. Once insurance claim is paid, the property paid for becomes the property of the insurance company.<br/>

</div> Get a truck and enlist friends so you comply with the deadline of December 15.  You must comply with the city regulations entering and remaining on this hazardous property.  Arrange enough help so that you can clean out whatever isn't burned to a crisp in two hours.

Excellent suggestion FIC. Might I add, it seems the goal is not to load the truck. It is to get as much out of the house and onto the lawn as possible. After the 2 hours is up, you can load the truck. You can verify this with those involved.

</div> The lawn is still part of the property.  The sheriff can toss it into the street.  It needs to be on the sidewalk, public property and not any part of the real estate.  Having had a fire in the house, there probably is not that much worth saving, anyway, that half a dozen people and a truck cannot cart away in a couple of hours..

To the street, is a term meaning the devil strip between sidewalk and road where anyone can pillage and the trash collector is expected, within reason to clean up on trash day. Parking helper vehicles there and the constant flow of people assisting is usually sufficient enough to stop any scrap hunters from trying to pillage until is only the actual remains after all helpers have gone.<br/>

I wish to inform you that you may contact the law office and register your interest as a buyer. The owner apparently still has the Title. There may be a lien held on the property by the finance company and the State on account of the taxes due. You may ascertain the amount claimed by each party (finance company and State) to settle outstanding dues before making your offer.<br/>

								Hi,<br/>
We have owned a condo in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico for 4 years.  It's an unbelievable nightmare, 30% of owners have abandoned their place, only a couple of owners still go there at all.<br/>
We own it free and clear and want to quit paying dues and taxes so that the state takes it.  What I am wondering is - if the state takes it, what happens next?  If it's shown we owe $1,000. but the place sells for $125,000. what happens to the remaining $124,000.  Of course we'd like it.<br/>
We are afraid of even going back to Mexico.....so selling isn't something we are considering.....we own the most expensive unit in the building (paid $305,000. dollars).  The manager saw us as rich and has threatened a ""attempted murder"" filing against my husband, unless we settle.  She set us up, she hired two guys to accompany her and they came to our unit.....nothing happened, but these two guys were her ""witnesses"".  She wants $40,000. dollars to settle.  This is only one thing that has happened, it's not worth the money to hold on to the place, and so we think of not paying, letting the state take it.....<br/>
Anyone have any ideas or knowledge of what will happen?<br/>
many thanks

								Re: Repossession in Mexico<br/>
<br/>
One thing I can likely guarantee, if you return, you will be arrested on trumped up charges by the manager with her friends as witnesses. That is they way things operate down there. It will then require a large bribe to get out of jail. I am not going to tell you to walk out on your debt, but unless you have it financially tied to the US, they will have issues collecting anything here. Don't take it personally, they could have shot you or jailed you then. Last time I left Mexico, it was on the 7:30 AM flight and my understanding was the thief trying to steal my uncles estate and kill him who I was thwarting was going to arrive with the police chief by 9 AM to have me arrested on trumped up charges. Having accomplished my goal of recouping his estate and having him moved to a nursing home where his son could supervise and manage the estate, I left.

 If the state takes it for taxes, and it is later sold, they will get any proceeds of the sale. <br/>
<br/>
 If it were me, I would not return to Mexico but get a lawyer there to represent you -- one who has no ties to the owners of the complex.  And let the lawyer represent if you wish to put it up for sale.<br/>
<br/>
 A local real estate agent can tell what the unit would bring today on the open market so you can make a decision whether it is worth holding onto long enough to realize a sale.

								Re: Repossession in Mexico<br/>
<br/>
People there have told me that lawyers work in cahoots....but that's a good idea, but maybe it means the lawyer gets the money.  We've hired one lawyer.....she is just draining the entire condo and then we find out she isn't licensed and hasn't filed what she says she has.  <br/>

I know my husband would be arrested at the customs booth at the airport and then I would have to fly home to get the money, as my banker said ""even if you phone me and ask for money - I won't send it, there could be someone with a gun to your head"".  My husband is sure he would die in a Mexican jail.....hell, I'd probably die from the stress!  so we won't be going anytime soon. Guess we could take $40,000. in a certified check, but we would rather give the place away than give her extortion money. The USA doesn't let you take more than 10,000. cash out of the country and banks in Mexico won't take US dollars anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
Finding someone else to sell it is a good idea, better be someone we like, cuz they could end up with the money. <br/>
<br/>
I thought the government would send it to us or put it in our Mexican account....nieve.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys......

<br/>
If you.want to entertain an offer from them<br/>
I would put an agent in the middle --a lawyer on this side of the border-- who is used to doing business in Mexico.. Let them deal with them and receive the $$.<br/>
<br/>
I do not blame ypu about not wanting to go back. Stay home and stay safe. Let a lawyer handle the sale. That way you stand to get some of your money back without risking your life with banditos.

								Re: Repossession in Mexico<br/>
<br/>
Most of the lawyers there are flexible in their application of law. Consult the US Embassy for a lawyer locally they recommend. Cash can be moved by electronic transfer between the US and Mexico. I wish I could guide you but in Mexico, you are guilty until proven innocent. My wife is afraid to even travel to the resorts on the Yucatan, far away from where I had to deal with my uncles estate outside of Guad because one of opponents I manipulated his estate back from was the sister of one of the Governors. We drove over to Puerto Vallarta about 9 years ago. We have been passing out chunks of volcanic rock from the volcano field between them to all the teachers in our school district over the years.

I wrote te embassy, they didn't answer, but there is a list of lawyers on their web site.  I got a name off of that list, turns out she was disbarred a few years ago.  We've wasted thousands of dollars on her.  She says she filed against our developer for not paying dues,  but it's a waste of her time and our money and she should know it, because our developer changed us from a condo regeim to a civil association and under civil association rules - no one can be forced to pay!  She keeps billing us though, and sweet talking the boys in our place....and our manager who is buddies with her keeps paying her (minus her cut, of course).<br/>

Puerto Vallarta looks so good........but it is amazingly deceptive and corrupt.<br/>

</div> I would get a lawyer on the US side of the border who works in Mexico.  There are some that I know you can find from New York to Texas.  <br/>
<br/>
 If you have a US lawyer representing you, you can rest assured that you have some protection for lawyers are regulated by Bar Associations, you can check out their credentials beforehand, and their trust accounts they must keep inviolate.  <br/>
<br/>
 Relying upon lawyers in Mexico is dicey and should something go awry, you have no recourse.  Lawyers are accredited by the law school they graduated from, not a bar association.  At least with a US lawyer you have some protection and can work with them with more confidence.

Most of the system in Mexico is corrupt. I only went there to recover my uncles assets for his sons because I owed him for taking over-site of my dads ability to live there through retirement comfortably after my sister borrowed and never returned most of his retirement assets. I suggest if you are looking for a west coast retirement haven you consider <b>American Samoa</b> or The <b>Northern Mariana Islands. <br/>

Puerto Vallarta looks so good, for the most part people are sweet, there are no bugs or mosquitos, a few cockroaches, but the weather is perfect.  I guess the big thing is not to own anything, just rent.  And gays are taking over the place, and it makes my husband uncomfortable.....not that there's anything wrong with that.....but....these gays are very flamboyant ....we are both uncomfortable, so we'll let it go.

Mexico is a very interesting country. Unfortunately, it seems the majority of the people that are really great people are the poor people. The higher you move up the spectrum, the worse their moral proclivities. About the only ones you can trust for sure are the Federales. It is a paradox to me that the people of highest quality and great moral character are the most oppressed.

Read about Am. Samoa and Mariana Is. and Samoa looks great, think we'll go as it's even a easy flight - to Hawaii and then Hawaiian Air.  Mariana sounded cheap...?  We've been to Belize and St. John, they are really nice, maybe need to go again.<br/>
<br/>
We've had really great experiences in Mexico with doctors, my husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer, up here the doctor told him he had to have surgery within one month and get it out, our Mexican doctor said the cancer was as big as the tip of a needle, and he said you have twenty years to do something, or you may die of it in your 80's.  That was 8 years ago, he gets tested every year, and it's still no big deal.  So, professional people up here can be dicey....<br/>
<br/>
What's wrong with Mexico is the legal system, that a lawyer can hang out a sign saying she is licensed, but she isn't.  That you are guilty until proven innocent.  We know someone who had charges filed against him for non-payment of a loan....he spent 4 months in jail - sleeping on cement - until he was absolved of the crime.  Oh yeah, he was guilty, but he had lived in PV longer than the other guy or paid a judge.  You cannot press charges on a local, fighting someone on their home turf, so managers and store employees steal like crazy, like 20,000. dollars a month in theft.  But....I think fighting someone on their home turf is alive and well here too.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband had his wallet stolen in Mexico, they took the money, rearranged everything else and then took it to a ******'s store and left it........she phoned us.  Credit cards all there, just cash gone, I call that a kind theft.<br/>
<br/>
In Peru someone stold my purse, there was a policeman close by, so I pointed at the guy and told him.....the cop looked at me like I was stupid,....he said, ""you were sent here by the gods to take care of us, whatever we can get from you is what god wanted you to give us ...he didn't hurt you, it's okay.""

He said when he first got there, he met with his interpreter to get the lay of the land and asked him how he knew how to tell the good people from the bad people. He said the interpreter looked at him with a confused look and said ""What do you mean? They are all bad people."" That is why Latino's invade our country and multiply like cockroaches.

				 JOHN vs. JUAN<br/>
You have two families: ""John Legal"" and ""Juan Illegal"". Both families have two parents, two children, and live in Arizona ..<br/>

<br/>
Juan Illegal also works in construction, has NO Social Security Number, and gets paid $15.00 in cash ""under the table"".<br/>
<br/>
Ready? Now pay attention....<br/>
<br/>
John Legal: $25.00 per hour x 40 hours = $1000.00 per week, or $52,000.00 per year. Now take 30% away for state and federal tax; John Legal now has $31,231.00.<br/>
<br/>
Juan Illegal: $15.00 per hour x 40 hours = $600.00 per week, or $31,200 per year.Juan Illegal pays no taxes. Juan Illegal now has $31,200.00.<br/>
<br/>
John Legal pays medical and dental insurance with limited coverage for his family at $600.00 per month, or $7,200.00 per year. John Legal now has $24,031.00.<br/>
<br/>
Juan Illegal has full medical and dental coverage through the state and local clinics and emergency hospitals at a cost of $0.00 per year. Juan Illegal still has $31,200.00.<br/>
<br/>
John Legal makes too much money and is not eligible for food stamps or welfare. John Legal pays $500.00 per month for food, or $6,000..00 per year. John Legal now has $18,031.00.<br/>
<br/>
Juan Illegal has no documented income and is eligible for food stamps, WIC and welfare. Juan Illegal still has $31,200.00.<br/>
<br/>
John Legal pays rent of $1,200.00 per month, or $14,400.00 per year. John Legal now has 9,631.00.<br/>
<br/>
Juan Illegal receives a $500.00 per month Federal Rent Subsidy. Juan Illegal pays out $700 per month, or $8,400 per year. Juan Illegal still has $ 22,800.00.<br/>
<br/>
John Legal pays $200.00 per month, or $2,400.00 for car insurance. Some of that is uninsured motorist insurance. John Legal now has $7,231.00.<br/>
<br/>
Juan Illegal says, ""We don't need no stinkin' insurance!"" and still has $22,800.00.<br/>
<br/>
John Legal has to make his $7,231.00 stretch to pay utilities, gasoline, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Juan Illegal has to make his $22,800.00 stretch to pay utilities, gasoline, and what he sends out of the country every month..<br/>
<br/>
John Legal now works overtime on Saturdays or gets a part time job after work.<br/>
<br/>
Juan Illegal has nights and weekends off to enjoy with his family.

				I bought a bird feeder. I hung it on my back porch and filled it with  birdseed. What a beauty of a bird feeder it was, as I filled it lovingly  with seed. Within a week we had hundreds of birds taking advantage of  the continuous flow of free and easily accessible food.<br/>
<br/>
But then the birds started building nests in the boards of the patio,  above the table, and next to the barbecue. Then came the poop! It was  everywhere, on the patio tile, the chairs, the table…everywhere!<br/>
<br/>
Then some of the birds turned mean. They would dive bomb me and try to  peck me even though I had fed them out of my own pocket. The other birds  were boisterous and loud. They sat on the feeder and squawked and  screamed at all hours of the day and night and demanded that I fill it  when it got low on food.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, I couldn’t even sit on my own back porch anymore. So I  took down the bird feeder and in three days the birds were gone. I  cleaned up their mess and took down the many nests they had built all  over the patio.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, the back yard was like it used to be…quiet, serene and no one demanding their rights to a free meal.<br/>
<br/>
Now let’s see…..<br/>
<br/>
Our government gives out free food, subsidized housing, free medical  care, and free education and allows anyone born here to be an automatic  citizen.<br/>
<br/>
Then the illegals came by the tens and hundreds of thousands, millions.  Suddenly our taxes went up to pay for free services; apartments are  housing 5 families; you have to wait 6 hours to be seen by an emergency  room doctor; your child’s 2nd grade class is behind other schools  because half the class doesn’t speak English. Corn Flakes now come in a  bilingual box; I have to ‘press one’ to hear my bank talk to me in  English, and people waving flags other than ‘Old Glory’ are squawking  and screaming in the streets, demanding more rights and free liberties.  When asked why they breed like cockroaches, the reply is that it is a  cultural thing. You are part of the problem because you will then be  paying for 99 out the next 100 cockroaches bred.

I wish to inform you that you may serve a written notice to the mortgage company. If the matter is not resolved then you may file a lawsuit. You may demand damages on account of negligence shown by the mortgage company and costs. You will have to prove the negligence of the other party in the Court.

Whenever a borrower submits any document in connection with an application for a loan modification, the mortgage servicer must provide the borrower with a written acknowledgement of receipt within five days of the receipt of the document(s).  The mortgage servicer must provide the borrower with a written response if the lender denies the application which includes the specific reasons for the denial. However, in your case, these procedures were not followed and they were not even willing to provide information for your queries. Now you can think of foreclosure lawsuit. Foreclosure lawsuits have been successful which is brought by individual homeowners alleging bad faith by lenders in courts all across the country. Another final available weapon is a bankruptcy filing. Before, all this once again try to negotiate with the mortgage institution. <br/>
<br/>
I encourage you to have a full consultation with a competent attorney to evaluate the options fully.

</div> Ocwen is  most likely the servicer of the mortgage, not the original lender.  But since the house is in foreclosure, any fines the county  levies for its upkeep in the interim will go against the property which Ocwen or the new purchaser at auction will have to pay. Such assessments attach to the property.  You can return them with a note to send to Ocwen.<br/>

</div>
</div> If you take no further action to contest the foreclosure, it will go forward as a default. You have a right not to be harassed and threatened,<b> Fair Debt Collection Practices Ac</b>t [FDCPA] which provides you may tell them not to call you again, put anything they have to say in writing [a summons and complaint they filed should be adequate] and if they violate the FDCPA you may be entitled to $1,000 for each violation -- plus reasonable attorney fees.<br/>
<br/>
 My recommendation is that you download a copy of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act so you are familiar with your rights not to be harassed by a creditor -- and your remedy if they violate it.

<div class=""message"">I would like to know what can be done about a mortgage company that does not have staff that can answer simple questions. No one in this company knows anything. Even when they call you the rep never knows what is in your file. I am so done with Ocwen that I have walked away from my home of 10 years after trying to modify my loan at least 5 times since 2011 and being denied a short sale twice. Now it is on my credit report that the house is in foreclosure and a lock box is in place but my county is trying to make me responsible for the upkeep. I left the house almost a year ago after I informed ocwen that I would not be harassed or threatened anymore since they refused to negotiate.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Ocwen is  most likely the servicer of the mortgage, not the original lender.  But since the house is in foreclosure, any fines the county  levies for its upkeep in the interim will go against the property which Ocwen or the new purchaser at auction will have to pay. Such assessments attach to the property.  You can return them with a note to send to Ocwen.<br/>

								Re: Mortgage Company foul in Maryland<br/>
<br/>
Being contacted is not the issue. The issue is being harassed and threatened. The issue now is a foreclosure was started and I learned about it from the payment statement and my credit report. I don't have a problem with having it on my credit report but complete it, take the house, send me my 1098c, I put the amount on my tax return and be done with the whole situation. I can live with the foreclosure it just can't be in limbo.

</div>
</div>
</div> If you take no further action to contest the foreclosure, it will go forward as a default. You have a right not to be harassed and threatened,<b> Fair Debt Collection Practices Ac</b>t [FDCPA] which provides you may tell them not to call you again, put anything they have to say in writing [a summons and complaint they filed should be adequate] and if they violate the FDCPA you may be entitled to $1,000 for each violation -- plus reasonable attorney fees.<br/>
<br/>
 My recommendation is that you download a copy of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act so you are familiar with your rights not to be harassed by a creditor -- and your remedy if they violate it.

Keep in mind you may be charged with taxable income in you enter into a ""without recourse"" agreement. <br/>

Cancellation of debt income is equal to the amount of cancelled debt minus the fair market value.  There are some exceptions but it's an important consideration.

</div>Yes, although it's not quite that direct, there can be some offsets or exclusions. <br/>
<br/>
It's the same as if you'd not paid off a credit card. After years of trying to collect they write off the debt. That makes the debt income to you so you receive a 1099 for the amount. It's added to your income for the year it's issued.

</div> No, you don't have to pay income tax on the $30K.  The individual who receives the benefit of the writeoff, <b>the borrower</b>, has to pay taxes for it is the same as if he received a gift of that amount from you.<br/>
<br/>
  As lender, you have suffered a loss and may have a $30K writeoff for that year.  I would check with your CPA, however, to be sure you may take the writeoff if you keep the property.<br/>
<br/>
 Also, to the borrower, there are no subsequent ramifications if he executes a <b>deed in lieu of foreclosure</b>, deeds the property back to you.  Only when judicial foreclosure is granted could there be a deficiency judgment.  When a foreclosure is non judicial or in such case the borrower deeds back, that's the end of it for the lender as far as recovering any more money.<br/>

								Had a home foreclosed almost 2 years ago, and must wait 2 years to get a mortgage again.  Trying to get a mortgage now, was pre-approved for around $200,000.  Just today, almost 2 years since we were foreclosed on and had to move out, my old mortgage company just reported it to the Register of Deeds.  So now, even though it was foreclosed almost 2 years ago and we've been out of the house that long I have to wait another 2 years for a mortgage. So that means it is actually 4 years I can't get a mortgage due to the old mortgage company not filing their paperwork almost 2 years late.  Is there anything I can do?

I wish to inform you that the clock begins from the time that the foreclosure case has ended. Normally, the cut off date is taken as the date on which your prior home was sold in the foreclosure proceeding. If an FHA loan was involved, generally the clock begins on the date on which FHA paid the prior lender on its claim. <br/>

</div>
</div> You can buy on owner contract if you can find a seller who doesn't need all of their money out now.  A clause could be put in the contract that you will cash out in 2 years, <u>subject to financing being available to you</u>. That caveat needs to be in any contract with an escalation clause for no one can forecast what the mortgage market will be like 2 years hence or that a mortgage will be approved for you at that time.  <br/>
<br/>
 The 2-years rule is not hard an fast, either, for some lenders may approve a loan for you [at higher interest rate, of course] or shorter term.  Talk with some mortgage brokers instead of directly with banks and you may find a lender willing to take a chance and make you a mortgage now.

<div class=""message"">Had a home foreclosed almost 2 years ago, and must wait 2 years to get a mortgage again. Trying to get a mortgage now, was pre-approved for around $200,000. Just today, almost 2 years since we were foreclosed on and had to move out, my old mortgage company just reported it to the Register of Deeds. So now, even though it was foreclosed almost 2 years ago and we've been out of the house that long I have to wait another 2 years for a mortgage. So that means it is actually 4 years I can't get a mortgage due to the old mortgage company not filing their paperwork almost 2 years late. Is there anything I can do? Seems as if because of HSBC (old mortgage company) taking so long to file, I'm screwed out of 2 extra years. Do I have any recourse, or is the anything that can be done?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> You can buy on owner contract if you can find a seller who doesn't need all of their money out now.  A clause could be put in the contract that you will cash out in 2 years, <u>subject to financing being available to you</u>. That caveat needs to be in any contract with an escalation clause for no one can forecast what the mortgage market will be like 2 years hence or that a mortgage will be approved for you at that time.  <br/>
<br/>
 The 2-years rule is not hard an fast, either, for some lenders may approve a loan for you [at higher interest rate, of course] or shorter term.  Talk with some mortgage brokers instead of directly with banks and you may find a lender willing to take a chance and make you a mortgage now.

								My home is in foreclosure the previous date was set for Jan 2014, it was postpone due to a discrepancy in the lender applying mortgage payments to the account. I have submitted a corrective action letter to the lender to fix the problem and to remove the house out of foreclosure. No response from the lender but a new date has been set for March 2014. After carefully reviewing the fees I notice there are duplicate fees for the attorney and they are excessive from the previous reinstatement fees. Also the reason of the discrepancy is due to non communication on lender behalf and mine. In 2012 there were four payments that has not been applied to the account, all payments were sent in form of money orders. After receiving a notification from lender that payment was not applied due to partial payment and where returned to the bank., I started researching the issue,after carefully investigating I found that you can not send US post office money orders to a bank. I was able to redeem the money orders but I had to pay a fee to do so. After  sending clarification that the money orders were not in my possession the foreclosure was postponed. A research specialist from the lender contacts me via mail stating that there were two more money orders that were sent back to a bank. I am frustrated at this point, its been a year and I am just finding out that payments were not applied to the count and the home is in foreclosure due to the neglect of communication in my opinion. I must admit times were hard and I did not make the monthly payments but when I did they were sent back due to partial payments. The mortgage had increase due to a shortage in the escrow account (there has been no change in the insurance nor property tax), I am not sure what shortage that the lender speaks of, what can I do about this.

<br/>
I wish to inform you that you may serve a written notice to the bank informing them of the many shortcomings on their side and on account of which the additional fees should not be levied and nor should the house be foreclosed. If the bank does not resolve the matter then you may file a lawsuit requesting an injunction from the Court along with damages and costs. The burden to prove the allegations made by you in the Court will be on you.  <br/>

Thank you, I have written the letter and certified the letter to the bank as well as the attorney but I have not heard anything and time is running out. I am waiting on the response from the bank. Their attorney contact me via email to explain the excessive cost in attorney fees. Their response to the excessive fee are in the recovery corporate fee attorney fees are for foreclosure action and the other attorney fees are for foreclosure fees and cost. Not understanding the separate foreclosure fees when there is only one attorney. Again this is so frustrating on how lenders can get away with ripping people off

</div>When defending a foreclosure, lawyers usually institute an audit of the account, from the first payment and closing papers -- a forensic audit. That is part of the discovery process. Also an audit of all documents regarding the loan from closing papers, mortgage and note including any and all assignments. One is entitled also to a statement of attorneys fees, time and charges. Filed with the court for it to examine to see if they are reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
Often these audits show up major defects in the loan documentation and also in applying payments to the mortgage. Your case is not that unusual. <br/>
<br/>
Servicing agencies for the lender, and most loans are serviced by a servicing company, not the lender, they are paid a flat $7500 to foreclose on the loan.<br/>
<br/>
You really need an attorney representing you whose practice is foreclosure and mortgage defense. That way you will get full disclosure and accounting and for all you know since many mortgages were sold electronically, over and over in many, many instances the proper paper work never followed and the lender trying to foreclose does not have the original note. It is the note that is the instrument for the debt, the mortgage only securing it.<br/>
<br/>
If you can at least counsel with a foreclosure defense lawyer you may find your situation better than you think.

								Re: TENANT's Status in Countrywide(BOA) Foreclosing<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that your state laws will govern payment of security deposit. In this regard generally when a tenant moves out following a foreclosure, whoever owns the property at that time must return the security deposit to the tenant if security deposit was transferred. It further provides that previous owner will be liable if he had not transferred security deposit to new buyer in trustees sale. In some states like Connecticut you may thus claim your security deposit from purchaser of property even if old landlord has not given security deposit to new owner.<br/>

</div>
</div>
</div>As a renter in a property currently undergoing foreclosure proceedings, you have no financial liability to the bank whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
Your status is as a tenant/occupant of the property, and will remain at that status even when the property is foreclosed and ownership is returned to the bank, or if it's sold.  A lease of real property is considered an encumbrance against the property and follows to a new owner when ownership is transferred.<br/>
<br/>
In an ownership transfer situation, the security is supposed to transferred to the new owner as part of the closing process.  The truth of the matter, however, is that many LL owners who are behind in their mortgages often end up illegally spending a tenant's security deposit.  Your recourse, of course, would be to sue them to recover the SD funds, but as the LL likely has many other unpaid debts or judgments that came well before your claim, you'd have to stand in line behind them in order to collect your judgment.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that when the property changes ownership, your tenancy transfers intact to the new owner. If you have a fixed term lease in effect, the new LL cannot evict you prior to the expiration of that lease.  If you are on a month-to-month tenancy, the new owner need only give you statutory notice to vacate.<br/>
<br/>
If the property is foreclosed upon, you have additional protections granted to you by the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act of 2009.  That law, enacted by the Federal government, requires NO LESS THAN 90 days notice in order to terminate your tenancy, whether you are on a fixed-term lease or a month-to-month tenancy.

								I was suddenly evicted from my home two months ago following a foreclosure.  I have complaints about how all that happened, but for the moment let's leave them aside.  I left and was told not to return, and haven't.  I lived in a small town, and drove to a nearby city.<br/>
<br/>
I contacted the bank (a major US bank) the day of eviction to ask about what happened and about my possessions.  I was promised a phone call back and didn't get one, and checked into a hotel.  I then spent days trying to get them to call me and tell me what was going on.  The bank refused to respond to emails and every time I called, I got the run-around.<br/>
<br/>
I finally spoke with an attorney a week or so after the eviction, who suggested I take them to small claims court.  He even filled out the paperwork for me, but told me he could not represent me.  I thought of it as Plan B - but I still assumed that it was easier for both me and the bank to simply talk, even though I was having trouble with the bank doing that.<br/>
<br/>
The next time I spoke with the bank I mentioned the lawyer, and it seemed to spur them to take more action.  I began getting calls back which directed me to call an 800 number and ask for a specific person.  The only problem was that when I called the 800 number, I could not get through the automated system, and kept getting hung up on.  It claimed not to recognize my SSN or ZIP code.  I told them of the problem, both by phone to a different number (where I was told that only this person could help me) and by email (which went ignored).  They eventually stopped trying to call me.  <br/>
<br/>
I finally last week contacted my state attorney general's office as a last ditch effort.  I found them to be no help.  They got the bank to contact me again, but I was told finally today that the bank disposed of everything!  The person I spoke with was brazenly unapologetic about it, and offered no compensation for the lost possessions - I was simply met with stone cold silence when I asked.  I hung up on her before I started saying things I shouldn't.<br/>
<br/>
The attorney general's office did say they thought I probably lost more than $10,000 in items (which is the limit for small claims court), and I am not sure I can afford to take them to court anyway.  I was unemployed at the time of eviction, and while I have continued jobhunting, doing so while technically homeless is not easy, especially as I have very few clothes.  I am just stunned as to what sort of person would throw out items of value, even as I was trying to contact the bank and figure out what to do with them - I certainly hadn't abandoned the items and they had no reason to think so!  I feel there were things I owned that simply can't be replaced or shouldn't have simply been pitched - vital records (my SSN CARD, birth certificate!), gifts, my grandfather's train set, personal effects, etc., I am just amazed and numb right now.<br/>
<br/>
I'll go ahead and say it - we're talking about Chase here.  I have no kind words for them at all.  I need to know what I can do - or what you recommend I do.  Chase apparently isn't going to talk this out rationally, and they certainly haven't acted rationally.  <br/>
<br/>
I will also say I don't know if they completely emptied the house.  The attorney I spoke with first said that everything in the house belonged to me, including all major appliances.  The fridge and washer/dryer were purchased by me shortly after moving in - the stove and dishwasher I bought with the place.  If anything is still in the home I want it back.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice appreciated.

Anything you did not take prior to eviction can be set out to the curb immediately. It is not their problem.

I wish to inform you that if you had left your personal items then bank could confiscate those items and sell them to recover its amount due or may charge you for its storage. In foreclosure generally bank will give you notice of default and its intent to foreclose. If bank has not followed proper procedure then you may take action for recovering your loss. <br/>

Then you have no recourse if you are not aware what happened to them. You would be lying if you filed a court action seeking anything and claiming they disposed of the stuff improperly. I would not be surprised if you were sued for doing so. What usually happens if I were to venture a guess is the banks clean out agents legally had the stuff moved to the curb as the law provides, then after they were done, loaded up anything good you did not claim that they wanted and left the rest to be picked through. Then they cleaned up the leftover trash a few days later.

That is generally the way it goes. The alternative is they usually change the locks and clean it out later. Apparently some counties treat it differently though. Let me ask you this, did you leave everything? What was its value? What county?<br/>

<b>Physical Eviction</b><br/>

<ul><li> 														 																 									The physical eviction takes place after the eviction  judgment is entered. The Illinois court provides a specific amount of  time for the homeowner to leave, usually one to two weeks. If the  homeowners remain at the property, the lender files for a Writ of  Possession.

								Re: Bank has disposed of my entire household (Illinois)<br/>
<br/>
Disagreeable - I have posted what I know.  Yes, I left everything other than the clothes on my back and whatever was in my car.  Fortunately I did keep my laptop.  I also posted the guess at value, over $10,000.  All major appliances, all clothes, electronics, household supplies, tools, furniture, a book collection, some things I would have considered priceless though I don't know what their actual value would be.  Things I can't help but think a reasonable person would not have drug outside and left without making some attempt to contact me - and as I said, I made multiple efforts to contact the bank.  I actually have created a list of what was lost as best I can remember (I had a partial inventory I was working on saved on the laptop, and a program that kept a complete inventory of books, DVDs, and CDs).  <br/>
<br/>
I do not understand what happened and when, other than the statement I got today from someone at the bank that said it was disposed of.  I am assuming that meant no storage and no auction sale, just pitched.  AFFA - I appreciate the advice, in that I saw this said at a couple of places I visited, but I can't find anything about it in the law, and some places seem to say they don't have to do anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't make any sense to me.  I was told not to return, like I said, and made the decision not to return until I had the bank's explicit permission.  It seemed like a reasonable position to take, but I never got any permission or hardly any answer at all from the bank until today.  The bank drug its feet at contacting me back by ignoring or offering form answers to any email I sent.  I did not once get a helpful email from them, though I kept emailing because they at least seemed to get and read them.  (When I called, reps would refer to emails listed in my account.)  When I called, I tended to get the runaround, but no clue until today that the items were gone.  Either each rep hid this information from me after looking through my account, or they were disposed of fairly recently.  I don't have any way of knowing which.  I can't help but think someone might have told me that sooner, though, if they did get rid of the items right away.<br/>
<br/>
I can find nothing in the state law either way regarding the property (although maybe I am not looking in the right place, not being an attorney), and every website I visit I get conflicting answers posted regarding what, if any, responsibility the bank had about my possessions.  This is not Cook County if that's what you mean.  I am unaware of any other county that might have relevant laws.  I really would like to get some facts, and all I can find are guesses.  If the law says nothing, then I don't understand what happens - isn't there some sort of standard behavior that should apply?  Sorry, I hope this does not come off as too harsh, I am guessing you are at least well-intentioned, but this is very frustrating and I have no idea what to do about it.

movers and a locksmith (if necessary) at the property at the specified time of the <br/>
eviction.  Tarps  and  bags  may  be  necessary  in  case  of  inclement  weather. <br/>
The Deputy will meet the plaintiff at the address and notify the party where to put all <br/>

<br/>
Too bad to hear that. The foreclosure process in the United States should be speeded up to release much needed properties onto the market which is suffering from a lack of supply. Its latest research shows that 20% of foreclosed properties are vacant but not being sold to the public which amounts to 167,680 properties nationwide.

</div>Not the way the eviction process works.  Once an eviction order has been made, one has the designated time to get themself and their belongings out of the house, often only 24 hours.   The sheriff comes in with the authority to move everything out of the house to the curb.  <br/>
<br/>
Evictions are a very unpleasant process, but that is the way the law works.  Yu could try filing a small claims suit but it is unlikely you would prevail.

</div>I am a paralegal of over 20 years experience, have not only passed real estate law classes with excellent grades but spent 20 years in the real estate industry. What you have been told you have not wanted to hear.  But that is the law in every state.  Once the court has issued its order giving the owner back possession of his property and ordered the tenant evicted, the sheriff comes out to enforce the order.  The sheriff removes the tenant and his belongings to the curb and locks are changed.<br/>
<br/>
The only way one could conceivably get compensated for possessions in the place that were disposed of is if they can prove the eviction was not lawful.  <br/>
<br/>
Where you say you have retained an attorney I trust it is a lawyer whose main practice is real estate law.  Unlike medicine in which people recognize specialties, e.g. do not go to an ob/gyn when they need a proctologist, the field of law is even more specialized.  <br/>

</div>
</div>When tenants leave things behind after vacating a rental property, it is a different situation than when an unlawful detainer action is brought (eviction), the court has ordered possession of the property back to the owner and the tenant out by such and such an hour. In the first instance, a voluntarily vacating tenant, the landlord becomes involuntary bailee of the tenant's property and state laws vary on how the landlord is to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
In evictions, however, when a court order returns the property to the owner,  the tenant and all his belongings are to be out by the designated date and hour or else the sheriff will remove all -- and the owner will have the locks changed.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen too many evictions, the law that  is followed in each state to argue with you further. <br/>

								Re: Bank has disposed of my entire household (Illinois)<br/>
<br/>
Well, as I told you there was no eviction order, and I have read that once the foreclosure is complete, landlord-tenant law does apply.  But again, more importantly, I am not looking for further advice.

								Hello,<br/>
    I wanted to see if anyone may be aware of the options available to my situation.  In 2010 I got stationed overseas (currently residing) after buying a house in 2007.  I then became delinquent on the mortgage because no tenants moved into the property.  As of 2014, the original lender (bank) is still showing my loan active along with delinquent.  <br/>
     After much research, I found out there are individuals residing in the property.  After more research, I found out the property was sold at a foreclosure auction mid 2011.  From reviewing the foreclosure deed through public record online, it seems an unknown individual sold the property back to the homeowners association and not the bank.  So now the bank is still looking to me for the amount of the loan.  <br/>
     I've been working with the bank in order to apply for foreclosure or deed in lieu, but they require an assessment and access to the property.  Of course it is very difficult in order to supply a walk through of the property with me being overseas.  I've thought about contacting a lawyer, but are there lawyers that may work via chat/email/pc means?  <br/>
<br/>
Please any suggestions in where to start would be great.

I wish to inform you that you may contact the State Bar Association with your request. You may request them that you are seeking legal representation in a foreclosure matter and are posted overseas. Further, the lawyer must be familiar with chat/email/other online means. The State Bar Association will provide you with a list of suitable lawyers who can then be contacted by you.<br/>

I suggest you approach the JAG office with your problem and seek their guidance. The Soldiers/Sailors Relief Act should have protected your interests, had you been properly notified. It gives special remedy not usually available in general law. Even if limitations statutes toll, I suspect they are reset by your return to the US.

I wish to inform you that your husband cannot be held liable for any debt incurred by you before marriage. As regard tax refunds it may not be garnished because Federal laws only allows Federal or State agencies for garnishment and not private lenders. Further if your name was removed then you may not be held liable as you are no more a debtor. <br/>

<br/>
If you’re expecting a tax refund but have concerns about creditors garnishing it, you may be worrying too much. Federal law allows only state and federal government agencies (not individual or private creditors) to take your refund as payment toward a debt. However, once you deposit the refund into your bank account, these rules no longer apply. Depending on the laws of your state, private creditors may have access to those funds. Seek help from an expert attorney.

</div>If your house is worth more than $20,000 they can go to court and get a judgment and if you do not pay, go for a writ of execution against your real estate.<br/>
<br/>
The best remedy, the easiest for you, and considering they have every right to their lien and will win if they take you to court, settling with them on a payment plan you can live with seems the best route to take.<br/>
<br/>
You can still go after the contractor for what you paid for materials that he did not pay for that resulted in a lien on your house.

								Re: Contractor didn't pay subs<br/>

I wish to inform you that foreclosure may not be done. Generally banks have power to foreclose because it is secured asset but contractor may not have such a power to foreclose but can claim amount through garnishment or sale of your non exempt assets including premises against which lien is sought. Further if other company agrees then you may set up payment plan. Payment plan is made by agreement between parties.   <br/>

<br/>
Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am having a big problem with a bank and I need advice on what to do...please help me...<br/>
<br/>
Here's the situation:<br/>
<br/>
I got behind on the 2nd mortgage, then the 2nd mortgage bank wanted to foreclose on their portion of the loan (about $76,000) and sent a payoff cashiers check to the first mortgage bank for $142k-the balance of the first, but they put MY NAME as the remitter of the cashier's check. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately for the 2nd mortgage bank, the payoff amount was a few dollars SHORT, and the first mortgage bank thinking I had sent in the payment SENT THE CASHIER'S CHECK BACK TO ME! <br/>
<br/>
Now, the 2nd mortgage thinking they had paid off the first, foreclosed on my house on January 4, 2008. After the foreclosure, they started trying to evict me and I fought them. They have gotten 4 writ of possessions and each time, I had gotten a stay by appealing (prose.) <br/>
<br/>
On one of these hearings, the 2nd mortgage bank's lawyers got the judge to compel me to pay rent to the court and I paid rent of $650 for 8 months.<br/>
<br/>
When the fourth writ was issued, the court paid the accumulated rent payments to the 2nd mortgage company based on their claim to own my house.<br/>
<br/>
Also, after the fourth writ of possession was issued, I was told I couldnt appeal and an eviction was imminent from the Sheriff so I filed a quick chapt 13 bankruptcy to stay the writ.<br/>
<br/>
The 2nd mortgage company then filed a motion in bankruptcy court to lift the stay claiming ownership of the property. As proof, they attached the deed from the foreclosure for the $76,000 and also mentioned the fact they had been issued writ 4 times and I have appealed FRIVOLOUSLY each time to prevent them taking possesion of their property.<br/>
<br/>
The hearing for this motion has been postponed till January 4, 2009 because I brought it to the court's attention that the deed is still under my name.<br/>
<br/>
Now, all the while I have been fighting the 2nd mortgage, I was under the impression they had sent a replacement check to the first, but it now appears that they hadn't.<br/>
<br/>
How do I know? The first mortgage just sent me a collection letter threatning foreclosure due to non payment! Apparently the 2nd mortgage company never sent another check to the first mortgage company after their initial check was returned to me.  I had also stopped making payment to the first thinking they had been paid by the second.<br/>
<br/>
And guess what? It is the same law firm representing the 2nd who is now representing the first! This law firm handles most ALL foreclosures in my area. <br/>
<br/>
Isn't this a conflict of interest to be representing two different banks against the SAME person AND SAME property? Especially when one of the banks (the 2nd mortgage bank) may have foreclosed and  been proceeding without even having ownership to the house?<br/>
<br/>
Apparently this law firm also doesnt know that the 2nd may have foreclosed wrongly on me and (in my view) fraudulently.<br/>
<br/>
In the two years I have been fighting the 2nd, they have put me through hell. And now, it turns out THEY DIDNT EVEN OWN THE HOUSE!<br/>
<br/>
I will like to sue the living daylights out of the 2nd mortgage bank, AND the law firm.<br/>
<br/>
How can I do this? Can anybody recommend a law firm that practices in Georgia (Atlanta) that will take my case on contingency because I am broke. <br/>
<br/>
Do I have a good case against the 2nd mortgage company? Against the law firm? <br/>
<br/>
I feel that I do. <br/>
<br/>
I can proceed prose if I have to, but I much rather use a lawyer. PLEASE HELP!!! <br/>
<br/>
Any advise would be greatly appreciated.

What would you sue them for? <br/>
<br/>
They can keep filing until they get it right. And you are still in the home. Unless you are current on the loan they will eventually legally get you out.

								Re: Being Screwed by Bank...PLEASE HELP ME!<br/>
<br/>
What would I sue them for?<br/>
<br/>
Did you read my post?<br/>
<br/>
First, what about false representation?<br/>
<br/>
This bank represented to the court that they owned a property they didn't. Then, they got the court to decide in their favor based on this false representation.<br/>
<br/>
Second, what about wrongful eviction?<br/>
<br/>
Third, what about emotional distress?<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, what about fraud? <br/>
<br/>
The sent a payment to the first mortgage company pretending to be me.<br/>
<br/>
Are you a lawyer? <br/>
<br/>
I am not a lawyer, but it seems to me there is a long list of things this bank can be sued for.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a TARP recipient bank bailed out with taxpayer money. <br/>
<br/>
This bank is rushing to evict people caught up in the same mess as they without so much as due diligence to assure they owned a property before proceeding legally against the rightful owner. <br/>
<br/>
In this recessionary economy, that is the height of irresponsibility. Based on your response, I can only assume, you having never been on the tail end of and eviction order. Especially a fraudulent one at that.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your response. However, if you are a lawyer, I would appreciate more insightful assistance. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you....

I don't think a lawyer will take it for you to sue for damges, but you can try.<br/>

Your remedy is to have the banks' attempts voided...hard to get much more than that.<br/>

What would you sue them for? <br/>
<br/>
They can keep filing until they get it right. And you are still in the home. Unless you are current on the loan they will eventually legally get you out.

<br/>
What would I sue them for?<br/>
<br/>
Did you read my post?<br/>
<br/>
First, what about false representation?<br/>
<br/>
This bank represented to the court that they owned a property they didn't. Then, they got the court to decide in their favor based on this false representation.<br/>
<br/>
Second, what about wrongful eviction?<br/>
<br/>
Third, what about emotional distress?<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, what about fraud? <br/>
<br/>
The sent a payment to the first mortgage company pretending to be me.<br/>
<br/>
Are you a lawyer? <br/>
<br/>
I am not a lawyer, but it seems to me there is a long list of things this bank can be sued for.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a TARP recipient bank bailed out with taxpayer money. <br/>
<br/>
This bank is rushing to evict people caught up in the same mess as they without so much as due diligence to assure they owned a property before proceeding legally against the rightful owner. <br/>
<br/>
In this recessionary economy, that is the height of irresponsibility. Based on your response, I can only assume, you having never been on the tail end of and eviction order. Especially a fraudulent one at that.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your response. However, if you are a lawyer, I would appreciate more insightful assistance. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you....

								Re: Being Screwed by Bank...PLEASE HELP ME!<br/>
<br/>
I don't think a lawyer will take it for you to sue for damges, but you can try.<br/>
<br/>
Your remedy is to have the banks' attempts voided...hard to get much more than that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not a lawyer--mortgage industry worker.

My ex husband and I own a home together, in which he was awarded per our divorce decree and ordered to have it out of my name within a year. <br/>

<div class=""message"">TEXAS<br/>
<br/>
My ex husband and I own a home together, in which he was awarded per our divorce decree and ordered to have it out of my name within a year. <br/>
<br/>
Now he is wanting to just give up a foreclose on it and stating he is 2 months past due. Basically giving up. It is on the market and has been for 5 months.<br/>
<br/>
My question is what legal options do I have to force him to refinance it so my credit is affected and also if he does foreclose, is there any way I can prevent it from hurting my credit since he was ordered to have it out of my name?</div>
</div>
</div>

Once the loan is 90 days past due, the mortgage is in default, the lender can send out a notice stating that, they will own the home and set a sale date. Texas is a non judicial state for foreclosure so they do not have to file a suit -- just declare you in default and set a date to sell the home.<br/>
<br/>
In order to have the mortgage out of your name, the lender would have to agree to release you. Your husband can apply to the lender to have you removed and only him liable, but the court can not force the lender to do so through your divorce. It is the lender's business decision to make. The court  can only order him to apply to do so.<br/>
<br/>
As to refinancing, one has to have at least 20% or more equity in their home for lenders will only finance 80% of the market value. And their credit must be good. With his letting the loan go behind, even if the value was there, a lender would be reluctant to make a refinance loan in this tight mortgage market for delinquencies are reported to the credit bureaus beginning with the first missed payment. His credit is shot for refinancing. <br/>
<br/>
Your option at this point is to pick up one of the payments so the loan does not go to default -- the loan become 90 days overdue which will stop it going to foreclosure. You need to contact the lender immediately and get that payment made. Time is of the essence.<br/>
<br/>
You are entitled to be kept abreast of the status of the loan since you are jointly responsible with him.<br/>
<br/>
So, with your being on the mortgage, his choice not to pay it, let it go delinquent is hurting your credit and a foreclosure, even more so for it will stay on your credit report for at least ten years -- damage you buying or even renting another home. And if the lender sells the house for less than what is owed, they may go after either or both of you for any delinquency, attaching bank accounts and other assets. <br/>
<br/>
By picking up a payment, keeping it from going to foreclosure, at least you will have bought the time to get him back before a judge and have the appropriate orders made.

								Re: Possible foreclosure due to divorce -- State of Texas<br/>

PS: Since he is unable or unwilling to keep the house, perhaps it would be timely to request the court revisit their award of the house to him and have him deed it to you. If you wish to keep the home, this might be the best opportunity. If the loan terms and/or amount are onerous, email me up and I may have some options to deal with the loan -- especially if made by one of the major lenders.

I apologize for just seeing this post years after the fact, and I am sure that this situation has been resolved one way or another. <br/>
<br/>
There are ways out there to stop a foreclosure including Loan Modifications and filing for Bankruptcy.  <br/>
<br/>
There is also a way to Refinance a mortgage up to 95% conventional and 96.5% on FHA for divorce circumstances, which most attorneys or real estate experts do not know or fully understand.

<div class=""message"">The property next to my grandmother sold at sheriff sale. The deed was transferred to new owner on August 1st., but the previous owner still hasn't moved out. Have been very concerned about the things I see happening at the foreclosed property. Is there a standard number of weeks given to previous owners before they must vacate?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your help.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>Just because the property has been sold doesn't always motivate a former owner to vacate the premises that they have occupied prior to the sheriff's sale.  As AFF has mentioned, if the property is not vacated, the occupants will have to be lawfully evicted.<br/>
<br/>
If there are tenants living in the property, and they possess a bonafide lease on the property, that is an encumbrance on the property.  The Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act protects the tenants from eviction just because of a foreclosure sale by requiring that new owners honor their existing lease until it expires.  For month-to-month tenancies, the tenants must be given NO LESS than 90 days notice prior to being required to vacate.  All of this assumes that the tenant follows the terms of the original rental agreement and pays rent to the new owner.  At any point, if they violate the terms of the rental agreement, the new owner can evict them the same as any other tenant could be.<br/>
<br/>
If it is the foreclosed owner that still resides in the property, then they typically are given 3 days following the sale (upon proper written notice) to vacate the property, after which the new owner must evict them according to their state's legal eviction process.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what's going on in the house that is concerning.  If you feel that the previous owner is basically looting the house or creating waste, then it's essential that you alert the new owner to this issue so that they can take the necessary steps to protect the property from further damage.

								I am in the middle of a divorce settlement in Australia.  I currently own property worth $1350,000 in Colorado with my ex husband.

He is moving back to the USA and will try to establish his credit rating again, work on the property to increase it's value and then apply to the bank to take on the whole mortgage in his name.  He is wanting 24 months to do this and my lawyer here thinks it's too long for me to be exposed (as still on both the mortgage and title for that time).  What are my risks if I let him have 24 months to transfer the mortgage.  Keep in mind that if the bank does seek a deficiency judgment from our previous property, they will likely place a lien against the remaining property (which will still be in both our names).

</div>That's certainly one way to resolve the matter without a foreclosure on the relative's credit.  I wouldn't be expecting a substantial cash payment, given that that as of the signing of the quitclaim deed and transfer of ownership, your relative becomes a tenant in the property for the following year for free.  That in itself is a pretty substantial concession worth a heck of a lot.  And be sure to get EVERYTHING IN WRITING - you may also want to have a real estate attorney of your choice review any contracts to ensure that the deal is exactly as it's being represented, with no surprises.

So, what's in this for the investor? He said, ""There is a lot of risk associated with this.<br/>
I will be fighting with the bank"".<br/>
<br/>
So what happens after he secures the quit claim?<br/>
The whole thing seems somewhat sketchy.

</div>The<b> first</b> thing your relative should do is consult with a foreclosure defense attorney in Florida.  She needs an <u>informed</u> opinion of her legal status and options.  There's a possibility that the foreclosure could be defeated for many mortgages are around that fail the securitization test -- notes missing, phony mortgage assignment documents-- a very complex situation for mortgagors, mortgagees and the courts in general.  <br/>
<br/>
Eight months into the foreclosure process, even if she accepted the deal, the ""investor"" cannot guarantee her ability to remain on the premises for a year. An attorney needs to look at the file and give her an informed opinion of how legitimate the foreclosure is and whether there are other options for her than conveying her interest out -- quit claim or not.<br/>
<br/>
Where the ""investor"" is not offering to take over her position with the lender, take an assignment of the mortgage, your relative is still liable.  If in fact she is that far under water there is a distinct probability that once it is sold after foreclosure there will be a substantial deficiency.  Which deficiency will attach to her and to her estate for 20 years.<br/>
<br/>
Tell her to see a foreclosure defense lawyer.  That is the best way you can help her.

								Re: Quit Claim Proposal From Investor<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the cogent replies.<br/>
The situation is more dire than I originally painted.<br/>
Mortgage is actually close to 2 million dollars.<br/>
Home and premises in deteriorated condition.<br/>
Attorney has been advising during the foreclosure process but apparently his bill is also in arrears.<br/>
A friend of mine who is an attorney says the judge will not look kindly on the fact that no mortgage payments have been made for five years.<br/>
Florida foreclosures are averaging 24 months or more to conclude, but that may not be the case here.<br/>
Certainly there would be a deficiency in excess of one million dollars were the property sold today.<br/>
The relative is almost 80 years old. There would be almost nothing in the estate, nonetheless it is a shock to learn that the liability would extend for twenty years. <br/>
There do not appear to be many viable options, if any, at this point.

So the present owner has no appreciable assets, hasn't made payments in years, and is deep underwater on the property. Signs a quit claim to the investor for cash and a promise of tenancy for a year.

Turns out the investor owns an adjacent property, wants to combine the two, and does not want to wait an undetermined period of time to do it. He wants to move on this now.<br/>
I can only assume that he believes that securing a quitclaim will advance his plans.  Various banks have taken 50% haircuts on similar properties in the area, and that's what he thinks will happen with this one.<br/>
So he either waits for the foreclosure and buys, secures a quitclaim, or persuades the owner to visit the bank with him and make a three way deal.<br/>
But he does not want to wait, and thinks getting the owner to make a deal with him and the bank is not going to happen.  So he goes for the quitclaim, and then makes the half price offer to the bank.<br/>
He says this entails a lot of risk, but I am not seeing that.  The quitclaim would go to an LLC that has no assets.  He stands to lose only the cash payment, legal fees, and his time.

</div>It will allow him to approach the lender with a lower offer, not requiring elderly persons agreement. If the lender does a short sale, they come after elderly person for deficiency.

</div>
</div>
</div>A quit claim only serves the ""investor"" for she will still be liable for the mortgage. Yet he will have the property. I would strongly advise her to ""forget it."" She could quit claim it to me or any of the numerous people who buy people's interests in property, pay them cash to get out. And rent or otherwise finagle during the foreclosure process. <br/>
<br/>
She needs to get out from under liability for that mortgage and, frankly, the only way she can do it at this point is to (1) work with the lender for short sale with the stipulation they will not hold her liable for any deficiency, a ""without recourse"" clause, but most likely (2) file bankruptcy. The latter will (1) stop the foreclosure, (2) when it clears -- providing she makes sure she is cleared not just of the mortgage but any deficiency judgment, she can spend the rest of her years in relative peace.<br/>
<br/>
Filing bankruptcy will give her most likely another year in the property, or close to it -- from what I know of bankruptcy court schedules -- relieve her of any liability for the property forever. And leave what income she does have free and clear for her to manage now -- free from debts.<br/>
<br/>
And if this neighboring investor wants the property that badly, then he can make his offer through the trustee.  Loans can be renegotiated in bankruptcy but she would have the benefit of a trustee approving the sale -- if she agrees to it.

<div class=""message"">Exactly. What the bank will do is the wild card. But why all the gyrations with the quitclaim? Why not go to the bank, express interest, and tell them to get agressive with the foreclosure?<br/>
What leverage does the quitclaim give him with the bank?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>He cares not one whit about the bank -- just his own interests.  It buys him time to rezone the property, waltz with the bank and maybe come out on top.

								Re: Quit Claim Proposal From Investor<br/>
<br/>
get a new attorney,  ask him what you can do to stall the foreclosure as long as possible, and live fo free.    At the last possible moment file bankruptcy and stall some more.    Wipe all debts out in bankruptcy.

I wish to inform you that if you are owner of premises then you do not have to leave premises. In this IRS form 1099A and IRS form 1099C may have been issued to you and this could inform you sale price of your premises. If there is no sale then no such form can be issued to you. Further you can inform lender that as ownership is not transferred therefore you cannot be made to leave premises. <br/>

								We bought our home/farm in 2004 through local Bank, for $247,000.  A few banks bought it and it finally came to Citi-mortgage.  We bought another 9 acres for about $60,000 another time and financed it through a totally different local bank.  In 2007 we took out a second mortgage with Citi for $40,000 on our home/farm.  We paid to have it done and assumed it was correct at the time.  Four years ago we had offers to buy the 9 acres.  The local bank said there was a problem...it was secured.  We had some other major family and health issues, the offers ended and we put this on the back burner. Two years ago my son is renting from us and wants to buy the 9 acres.  Again the bank says the land is secured  and they can't do anything about it.  At the same time I was trying to get a lower interest on my home/farm loan with Citi.  With much, much investigation and phone calls, I find out that Citi has my 9 acres secured for my two mortgages and my farm/home is unsecured.  No one can tell me who the title company was who did this mix-up. They realize it. Their title person says ,Hey You guys now have basically an unsecured loan and no body is willing to do anything about it.  Each time I call Citi, I talk to a different person who says ""Oh yea, I can see from your file what the problem is, I'll take care of it."" This has been going on for 2 years.  I was not able to refinance two years ago at a 2% difference because of this problem and now I'm running into the same thing trying to get a 1% rate change.  I feel like we are being held hostage. No one can tell me who the Title company is.  I've contacted all around this area and none did it. I want my land cleared.  I don't want anything that's not right, but as of now, I feel like they have cheated me out of thousands of dollars by not allowing me to refinance two years of lower rates, caused me the loss in the sale of the 10 acres 3 times, and emotionally left us drained. As of now, no one can do anything about it.  At Citi I have repeated my story at least 20 times, because there was never one person who took my calls. Help!

</div>Florida is a state where judicial foreclosure is the process. And deficiency judgments can be had on short sales or foreclosure sales -- that are valid for 20 years. Without knowledge of how that foreclosure is filed -- whether you are named as well as your husband -- it is impossible for anyone to tell whether or not you would be impacted by having the foreclosure on your credit report -- and extremely important -- whether or not a deficiency judgment could be entered against you.<br/>
<br/>
It is imperative you gain access to the court file. Most Florida counties I know have their court dockets online. Find out if you are co defendant in the foreclosure suit. if you did not sign the mortgage note, then you will need to be sure you are not named as defendant, do not end up with a foreclosure on your record -- and worst case scenario, have a judgment against you for 20 years should they sell for less than the mortgage amount.<br/>
<br/>
If you find you are named as defendant in the foreclosure suit, it is imperative that you get an attorney to get you removed and the record set straight. If you think it is expensive for an hour or two of a lawyer's time -- a consultation, at least -- having a foreclosure on your record will not only keep you from buying cars, mortgaging a home of your home for quite a while, will drop your credit score low enough perhaps that you may even have trouble renting -- and your car insurance will cost you more. The differential in insurance alone may well be more than an hour or two of a lawyer's time.<br/>
<br/>
Check the court record. And then decide how far you need to go to clear the situation up.

Without knowledge of how that foreclosure is filed -- whether you are named as well as your husband -- it is impossible for anyone to tell whether or not you would be impacted by having the foreclosure on your credit report -- and extremely important -- whether or not a deficiency judgment could be entered against you.<br/>
<br/>
It is imperative you gain access to the court file. Most Florida counties I know have their court dockets online. Find out if you are co defendant in the foreclosure suit. if you did not sign the mortgage note, then you will need to be sure you are not named as defendant, do not end up with a foreclosure on your record -- and worst case scenario, have a judgment against you for 20 years should they sell for less than the mortgage amount.<br/>
<br/>
If you find you are named as defendant in the foreclosure suit, it is imperative that you get an attorney to get you removed and the record set straight. If you think it is expensive for an hour or two of a lawyer's time -- a consultation, at least -- having a foreclosure on your record will not only keep you from buying cars, mortgaging a home of your home for quite a while, will drop your credit score low enough perhaps that you may even have trouble renting -- and your car insurance will cost you more. The differential in insurance alone may well be more than an hour or two of a lawyer's time.<br/>
<br/>
Check the court record. And then decide how far you need to go to clear the situation up.

								Re: Foreclosure questions... How can I find out the status?<br/>
<br/>
The document I found on the court website showed a motion to dismiss foreclosure.  The order says the ""motion is granted without prejudice""  Does this mean there is no longer a foreclosure on the house? If so should the credit bureaus have to remove from my credit report?

								My mother has passes and I am in the process of cleaning out her manufactured home located in TN.  I have been in contact with the lien holder for the home.  I have provided the POA and Death certificate as requested.  The land that the home is on belongs to my uncle.  He was not leasing the land to my mother.  I got a notice of abandonment from the lien holder, after them stating they would give me time to remove her personal belongings.  The loan payment was paid through the 06/25 due date.  I also received a notice of intent to sale on or after 07/16/2013.  (at a private sale)<br/>
I did inform them that my mother had moved in with my family a few months ago due to her condition, but that we visited the property about once a month.  <br/>
The letter implies that they are selling the personal property left inside as well.  I am no where near finished going through the personal property. The letter is dated 07/05/2013, delivered 07/11/2013.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel as if they are trying to take possession of the property to avoid the expense of foreclosure sue to the balance remaining on the property and location.  The estimated cost to relocate the property is over 50% of the remaining balance.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything I can do?  I do not want to lose my mother's possessions?

								Re: Manufactured Home Notice of Abandonment<br/>
<br/>
First, legally speaking, the POA is no longer valid. Mom is dead. The court appointed executor is the only one with legal authority to claim moms things. The lender is certainly allowed to reclaim the abandoned trailer for resale upon default.  If you wanted to keep it, other arrangements need to be made quickly. If you make up the payments and probate the estate, you can likely get title to the trailer via court process, if you pay off the balance of the loan.

								Greetings,<br/>

My husband and I divorced in 2005 and because my husband would have lost his home, I remained on the mortgage-he makes his payments in a timely manner.  The issue is that my credit is affected by this because it shows that I am over-extended financially.  I own my own home outright and have no current mortgage.  He has not been able to refinance and has no intention of selling his home.  He and I get along fine yet I want to move on and would not be able to qualify for a mortgage if I needed one.<br/>

</div>The only way to get off the mortgage, out of liability, is for the lender to release you.  In this market, this is unlikely as you have probably found out already.<br/>
<br/>
Owning your own home outright should look good on your financial statements.  And with that substantial equity applied to a new purchase, eventually you may find a lender willing to make a mortgage.  Reducing or eliminating any other obligations should go in your favor.<br/>
<br/>
With the current mortgage picture, banks being exceedingly parsimonious handing out loans, historic credit standards have gone by the wayside.

I would seek the advice of a real estate attorney and look into an illegal eviction.

The burden of proof for all your claims is on you.  If he filed an unlawful detainer, which was posted to your door and you ignored the hearing, the judge would have given 10 days for you to move. It sounds like all this occurred within the timeline you mention.<br/>

<br/>
No nothing posted on my door. <br/>
<br/>
As I had no attorney I looked up the Viriginia State Law on how long the former owner could legally stay in the home and it stated three days after ownership.  I was under the impression that I had three days from the sell of the condo.<br/>
<br/>
The man just appeared and demanded access. I was extremely distraught and just did what he said to do.  It is only now, a month later, that I am thinking something was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
As I have a little girl I was thinking of her safety when I simply abandonded my property and moved back to Alaska.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your input.  I am clueless with this stuff.

<span style=""color:#000000"">If a landlord locks you out of your apartment or shuts off your utilities, you should immediately go to court to get what is called a temporary restraining order, or TRO. A TRO tells your landlord to stop doing something illegal and orders her to put you and your belongings back into your apartment and restore any utilities she may have shut off. A TRO is usually the quickest way to get your apartment back. You may also be entitled to money damages of at least three months' rent, plus any court costs and attorney's fees.</span>

The Condo was not a rental.  The man who changed the locks was not a landloard.  <br/>

He represented an investment firm that bought my condo through a foreclouser sell that took place 5 days before he knocked on my door asking for access, i.e. the keys to the condo.

</div>This was absolutely illegal.  However, in order to know against whom you can seek recourse, you would need to know for sure who actually locked you out.<br/>
<br/>
I would seek the advice of a real estate attorney and look into an illegal eviction.

The burden of proof for all your claims is on you.  If he filed an unlawful detainer, which was posted to your door and you ignored the hearing, the judge would have given 10 days for you to move. It sounds like all this occurred within the timeline you mention.<br/>

								Re: Lock Changed on Forclosed condo Before Property in New Owners Name.<br/>
<br/>
No nothing posted on my door. <br/>
<br/>
As I had no attorney I looked up the Viriginia State Law on how long the former owner could legally stay in the home and it stated three days after ownership.  I was under the impression that I had three days from the sell of the condo.<br/>
<br/>
The man just appeared and demanded access. I was extremely distraught and just did what he said to do.  It is only now, a month later, that I am thinking something was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
As I have a little girl I was thinking of her safety when I simply abandonded my property and moved back to Alaska.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your input.  I am clueless with this stuff.

								My family is having an issue right now, and was hoping to get some advice on how to proceed.<br/>
<br/>
We have been in the loan modification process since February.  The problem?  The bank seems to be having an issue with figuring out her income because they can't figure out how she gets paid.<br/>
<br/>
The borrower gets paid in an unorthodox way  - she works as a nurse for a registry, she:<ul><li>she works at different locations, based on the needs of the registry on any particular day - like a temporary assignment</li>
<li>gets paid an hourly wage plus travel expenses</li>
<li>receives pay on a pay card (debit card) within hours of turning in a timecard via fax</li>
<li>receives one or more paycheck stubs on a weekly basis - one for each day she worked, but all dated on the same date (the stub processing date)</li>
<li>her hourly pay is taxed</li>
<li>her travel pay is NOT taxed</li>
</ul><br/>
Despite many attempts at explaining how the pay works (including at least 100 phone calls, letters from the borrower, and letters from the borrower's employer), the bank simply cannot figure out her actual usable income in order to process the modification.  All of her paycheck stubs, pay card records, and every other requested document to support her income has been submitted time and time again.  Our biggest fear is that the modification will be denied due to the bank's inability to add the numbers and figure it out.  We have been assured that they have not yet DENIED the modification and it is supposed to be pending.  Meanwhile, due to the legal ramifications, of course the bank is refusing to accept any partial payments towards the mortgage and will only accept the full past due amount back to February.<br/>
<br/>
The kicker is that about a week ago, we found a notice on the door stating that the bank was proceeding with a sale at auction, indicating that the foreclosure is moving forward.  We live in California, and there is new legislation that takes effect in January that prohibits lenders from foreclosing while a loan modification is pending.  The problem is that the system doesn't even show a modification has been requested yet.  Forms have been submitted to the bank but the point of contact with the bank STILL HAS NOT SUBMITTED IT FOR APPROVAL.  He has all that paperwork and is still holding onto it, and the systems don't show that a modification has even been requested for our loan.<br/>
<br/>
Is there ANYONE out there who has a clue what we can do to stop this?  Is there any law in force that protects the house from being sold pending the modification process we are still in the midst of?<br/>
<br/>
ANYTHING you can suggest would be terrific.

								Re: Bank Proceeding to Foreclosure Sale - During the Modification Process?<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that borrower can show income through return of income filled with IRS. In his regard if borrower is having income then that income will come in reflected with returns filled with IRS. Further person can send in writing communication to bank that modification process is underway and that they are not showing correct information. If a person feels that foreclosure will be done then an injunction can be taken from court that bank should not foreclose the property untill modification matter is not resoled. <br/>

								Most lenders a short sale is the preferred method of dealing with a defaulted loan, since the lender gets a new buyer, and the house never goes vacant. In Arizona, “anti-deficiency statutes” prevent lenders from foreclosing on a property and then suing the borrower for the unpaid loan balance. These are powerful and effective consumer laws that, during our severe recession, have saved thousands of homeowners from bankruptcy.

I wish to inform you that fraudulent transfer law seeks to extend a creditor’s reach to assets no longer in the debtor’s possession, and can offer numerous specific remedies which may operate against strangers to the creditor-debtor dispute. Further, an action to set aside a transfer as fraudulent against creditors is likely to fail despite a showing of actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor (the “badges of fraud”) if the transfer has left the debtor with sufficient assets to cover the claims against him.<br/>

Please allow me to <u>clarify</u> some things, to see if your reply and opinion would differ:<br/>
<br/>
The ""Lender Liability""  Claims I asking about would based on  ""Title"",  which the Lender's Title Insurance and Private Guarantors could take  care of,  NOT  ""Fraudulent Transfer"" Law, since the transferred  property in THIS situation was NOT done to avoid the Creditor's reach. <br/>
<br/>
The Debtor is this situation would be in prison, and would be found to have NO assets for either the Creditor OR the BFP to seek recovery from. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, despite understanding the entire situation, the Lender would STILL be refusing to use the Title Insurance and Private Guarantors to take care of the Debt, and would insist on proceeding with Foreclosure since the Loan is ""Secured"" regardless, because they'd prefer to Profit in THAT way. <br/>
<br/>
This would be the MAIN reason that the BFP, whose property is unfairly saddled with  the Debt, would be FORCED to pursue the Lender, based on their ""Liability"" for  not following through on their ""Duty To Inquire"", with the<u> Prior Recorded Notice </u>in the Property records. <br/>
<br/>
So, with the evidence of the BFP's recorded Interest included here, combined with the understanding that this would is under ""Title/Property Law"", my question would remain the SAME:<br/>
<br/>
WHAT 2, MAIN ""Causes Of Action"" for ""Lender  Liability"" could the ""Bona  Fide Purchaser"" FILE against a Lender, if a  Loan was Fraudulently done  on the Property by someone OTHER THAN the  BFP.??

<b>Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I'm REALLY confused about THIS CA. Civil Code Provision, and was hoping someone could clarify for it me:<br/>
<b><br/>
""3439</b>.<b>09</b>.        (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of  law, a cause of action with respect to a fraudulent transfer or  obligation is extinguished if no action is brought or levy made within  seven years after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred.</b>""<br/>
<b><br/>
From what I've read online, this, CA Civil Code Provision seems to only benefit Creditors, who feel they're being taken advantage of by someone in a situation where the asset used for an obligation with the Creditor is Fraudulently Transferred, so the Debt doesn't have to be paid back to the Creditor.<br/>
<br/>
But what happens when an unusual Legal situation occurs, but one that could STILL fall under under the provision's requirements?<br/>
<br/>
For example, the Debtor, who feels they've been ripped off by the Creditor, when it was found that someone ELSE Owned the property that the Debtor used the Creditor for a Loan to buy, when there's proof that the Creditor should have known about the other owner? <br/>
<br/>
Or,  one who owned the property (Bona Fide Purchaser), who got ripped off by the Debtor, who stole the property from them, then deeded it to him or herself, thus constituting a ""Fraudulent Transfer"". Then, the Debtor took out a loan (Obligation) with the Creditor for their OWN benefit, when the Creditor had ""Notice"" of the True Ownership on Record; Then this Debtor Died, leaving the True Owner with the Debt  the Owner isn't responsible for?<br/>
<br/>
 If these two scenarios fall within the seven year Statute of said Provision, and an Obligation was based on a Fraudulent transfer, can either the Debtor OR the Owner use this same provision to file their own, perspective suits as well?? Is it written to be OPEN to interpretation by the Courts who can then apply it, under these different types scenarios in order to Rule on them??<br/>
<br/>
It would seem unfair, that ONLY a Creditor could take advantage of this particular Provision, otherwise WHY would the ""Transfer Act"" (under which this provision is ONE), be called ""Uniform""? <br/>
<br/>
And if the NOT, then WHAT other Law or Provision could either the Debtor or Owner in the above scenarios USE, that would give them the SAME, fair amount of time (the seven years), in which to FILE a Suit?<br/>

<br/>
The statute you quotes is a statute of limitations, the cutoff date for filing suit. It applies to everyone, not just creditors. The reason for limiting actions is so that years and years after an event one may not sue for evidence and witnesses are stale or gone and a defendant has little hope of defending such a suit. <br/>
<br/>
There are factors that can toll a statute of limitations, however. As to creditors, if a person flees the state to avoid being sued, that can toll the statute. There is fraudulent concealment, where the person conceals the evidence of fraud so the statute begins to run from the time of discovery of the fraud. <br/>
<br/>
As to the example you gave, it is not totally clear what the sequence of events was. How the individual 'stole' the property is critical. When one knew or should have known of the theft of the real estate and encumbrances.<br/>
<br/>
If the value is substantial, one should consult with a real estate attorney in California to find if there are circumstances that would toll the statute of limitations if suit would otherwise be barred by the statute.

Well, I didn't wish to be too specific; But I CAN tell you that it is the 2nd example that I'm dealing with.<br/>
<br/>
Now Here's the TRICKY part: the Fraudulent Transfer was done on March 10, 2005, But the ""Date of Obligation"" that stemmed from  IT,  didn't occur until Feb 3rd, 2006, which was actually one month AFTER the ""Date Of Discovery"" of the Transfer.<br/>
<br/>
So, based on the second example, excluding the Debtor's ""Fraudulent Transfer"" portion, if one were to file a Cause Of Action against the Creditor, based Solely on The ""Date Of Obligation"" portion, in which the Statute would NOT run until Feb 3rd, 2013, WOULD THAT WORK under this Provision, to move forward on??

								I bought the 7 acres next door to my farm. The property had been foreclosed upon, the previouse owner was 5 months behind. On the property was 2 pickup trucks, a car and a tractor. All vehicles were non-functional. The last phone number I had for the previous owner was disconnected and the seller had not been able to reach the previous owner. So, when we started clearing the brush, we called a wrecker service to come and haul the vehicles to the scrap yard. We used the proceeds of the sale to reroof the mobile home that was also on the property. <br/>
<br/>
The problem is, now the previous owner has showed up and wants to reclaim his vehicles and the mobile home. I would like to keep the mobile home, in a way. It has been left open for at least 2 years, with vermin (4 legged) living inside. But, it may cost more to get the mobile home habitable that it would to buy another one. But, what about the car, trucks and tractor? Where do I stand on that?

<b>Our intention is to either be awarded a monetary judgment for our labor and materials via Mechanics liens, or a respectful ""broom clean"" offer to vacate from the bank in the amount of $3000 to $5,000.</b> <br/>
<br/>
Much thanks for comments, answers, and inquiry on this subject!! I am currently deep into research on this and other related subjects. Of course I understand and respect the advice given by all those who give input. I have decided to complete current train of research with respect to Equitable vs. Legal Title as it a applies, 82/83 ejectment /writ of possession to eject adverse possessor who possessed realty more than 30 days, Mechanics Lien as it applies, and/or ""broom clean"" deal with bank before pursuing the Owner of Record for Quit Claim Deed due to the unique situation between all the players involved in this particular property.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in the specific case of this property there are a few items which I believe make it unique. Firstly, the bank involved has changed its name 3+ times in the last few years, lost a law suit against them where now they must pay 28+ million in damages to residence of California and are now not allowed to practice business in the state of California. I am most certain this bank (now known as H******* R*********) is either close to or too busy dealing with a possible FDIC takeover due to its major failings. (In other words: They have too much on there hands.) Also, the owners of record have left the home only after major vandalism by there own hand and this occurred over 2 years ago. We have been observing this house that long and there has been absolutely no activity on this property.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, EVERY neighbor surrounding the house on all sides and most on down the street are known by us and aware of the situation. They have ALL expressed there gratitude for our rehabbing of a terrible eye sour and danger in the community (lovingly referred to as ""the Big Yellow monster"") into a very tastefully painted and<br/>
landscaped property. The chances of inciting ""economic jealousy"" are slim to none.<br/>
<br/>
But as I stated I am continuing my research and delving deeper into this subject in order to be able to intelligently discuss, advise, and defend my current and, hopefully, long lived possession of this property. We do not expect nor do we intend to take owner after the 7 years. Our only intention is to improve our neighborhood, gain productive use of the property for a year or so, and to either be awarded a monetary judgment for our labor and materials via Mechanics liens, or a respectful ""broom clean"" offer to vacate from the bank in the amount of $3000 to $5,000. I wonder what your thoughts and opinions based on the unique context as I have explained it, understanding that your frame of reference is limited to what I’ve just posted.

so how do you solve the dilemma?  a non-recourse law is great for those who have fallen on hard times, through no fault of their own, but it does foster abuse by dishonest people.

Lets face it, the non-recourse foreclosue law is a double edge sword. I for one very much beleive it has it's time and place, and the time and place is ""Now""! If some want to beleive there are people taking undue advatage of this law, yes they may be right. <br/>

Bottom line is, who got us to this situation in the first place? If your answer was both the banks and our goverment, than you would be right! Based on that answer I sure can't feel sorry for either one of them.<br/>
<br/>
The non-recourse law needs to stay in place helping these poor souls out. Remember, this is effecting not only the borrowers but also their children that have to eat and live somewhere. We still have to find ways to put people back to work so they can afford providing for their families. Taking more money away from them is insane. Place yourself in this situation and I think for those of you that think it's a bad thing will than come around.<br/>

								I have a mortgage through chase bank. I had fallen behind on some payments and was assigned a loan officer to help with the situation. This began in October of 2011, since then I have complied with all requests and have submitted all necessary paperwork that this loan officer has requested. Repeatedly throughout this process he would request paperwork, then I could not get a hold of him for two weeks and when I did he would have no clue of the status on the account or where the paperwork is. Last I spoke with him about two months ago, he now avoids all my calls and does not return any of the messages I have left for him, he had assured me that the loan modification was going to be signed but just needed a bank statement (which I had already explained to him that chase did not issue a statement for this month). It has now been over 8 months and has put me in a very bad situation. I had taken out money from my retirement account so I can be ready for a repayment plan in case a loan modification would not go through. Any ways, Im not sure which direction to go with this. I have spoken to many chase reps with no resolve. I am now ready to fax this information once again and start this process all over with what I hope will be a new chase rep. To me this is a clear case of mishandling of my case and putting me in a very difficult situation. but I fear that this has taken so long that the damage may be to far for me to recover from. my intent has always been to keep the property. Any advice would be greatly appreciated

You might consider contacting and counseling with a lawyer who is experienced in mortgage and foreclosure defense for the bank which has legions of lawyers, has probably placed your file with their pre foreclosure department if you ever got more than 30 days behind, anyway -- a lawyer who represents you is the only person they will sit up and pay attention to.<br/>

								I have a mortgage through chase bank. I had fallen behind on some payments and was assigned a loan officer to help with the situation. This began in October of 2011, since then I have complied with all requests and have submitted all necessary paperwork that this loan officer has requested. Repeatedly throughout this process he would request paperwork, then I could not get a hold of him for two weeks and when I did he would have no clue of the status on the account or where the paperwork is. Last I spoke with him about two months ago, he now avoids all my calls and does not return any of the messages I have left for him, he had assured me that the loan modification was going to be signed but just needed a bank statement (which I had already explained to him that chase did not issue a statement for this month). It has now been over 8 months and has put me in a very bad situation. I had taken out money from my retirement account so I can be ready for a repayment plan in case a loan modification would not go through. Any ways, Im not sure which direction to go with this. I have spoken to many chase reps with no resolve. I am now ready to fax this information once again and start this process all over with what I hope will be a new chase rep. To me this is a clear case of mishandling of my case and putting me in a very difficult situation. but I fear that this has taken so long that the damage may be to far for me to recover from. my intent has always been to keep the property. Any advice would be greatly appreciated

</div>First, there is usually homeowner's insurance on the property which the lender would receive.  Even when loans go into default and the mortgagor fails to pay the  insurance, the lender keeps up the premiums on the insurance police.  <br/>
<br/>
Title insurance only insures the chain of title -- not condition or loss of the property.<br/>
<br/>
The set of IF's you set out, like not being able to hold the borrower liable, rarely occur. <br/>
<br/>
Many loans are insured by the government for deficiencies upon sale and can insure up to 80% of the loan value.

								Hello all....<br/>

My mom died, she was the only one on the lein/mortgage.. However, I am listed on the deed. I informed the bank/mortgage co. that my mom died. And that her belongings never went to probate court. I have remained in the house for the past year, however I am no longer able to make the payments on the loan, as i am disabled with a mentally handicapped / disabled younger sister who was also left in my care. <br/>
<br/>
My question is... Can Lender kick me out of the house? I am no longer able to make payments, What do i do about the deed? My sister and I have no where else to go, if they foreclose on the house I will be disabled with my severly disabled sister and homeless.<br/>

Can anyone tell me where do i go from here? What can I do? Do I have any rights seeing how I am disabled with a disabled dependent? <br/>

</div>You can absolutely get kicked out - because the payments are no longer going to be made.  You can expect them to foreclose on the property if that happens, unless you can figure out a way to pay the mortgage.  And unfortunately, being disabled won't stop that from happening (being disabled isn't a waiver from having to pay for the property).<br/>
<br/>
You may want to consider selling the house and moving in somewhere else that is less expensive to maintain - this goes for both you and your sister.  Or perhaps you can just rent out the house and move to an apartment yourself?  Just some suggestions.

You should have put the home on the market soon after your mother died.<br/>
<br/>
If you could make the payments they couldn't kick you out.  If you'd brought in a renter if there was space maybe.  <br/>
<br/>
Now the best you can hope is to find a place you can afford and move.

Disability does not give one any break on paying bills.  If you get 90 days behind, the mortgage will be in default and the lender need not take  or receive any more payments.  If you get 90 days behind and make any payments to the bank servicing the loan, they will keep it, not apply it to the mortgage and you will end up being foreclosed upon.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the lender can and will kick you out of the house, foreclose upon you -- UNLESS you can come to agreement otherwise.  Consider the possibility of a short sale which means working with the lender to accept whatever the house sells for.<br/>
<br/>
There is a recent federal program to help homeowners refinance and/or forego some of the principal amount on their mortgages when homes are under water.  BUT the person must be current on their mortgage.<br/>
<br/>
Facing reality gives one the opportunity to plan to mitigate the worst outcome.  You can apply for low cost housing, the foreclosure process can take some time, especially if you are in a state where the lender must go to court.  But if you cannot make the payments, the heartless banks will foreclose.  They have to.

Can anyone tell me where do i go from here? What can I do? Do I have any rights seeing how I am disabled with a disabled dependent? <br/>
<br/>
Any help would be much appreciated...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you</div>
</div>

Disability does not give one any break on paying bills.  If you get 90 days behind, the mortgage will be in default and the lender need not take  or receive any more payments.  If you get 90 days behind and make any payments to the bank servicing the loan, they will keep it, not apply it to the mortgage and you will end up being foreclosed upon.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the lender can and will kick you out of the house, foreclose upon you -- UNLESS you can come to agreement otherwise.  Consider the possibility of a short sale which means working with the lender to accept whatever the house sells for.<br/>
<br/>
There is a recent federal program to help homeowners refinance and/or forego some of the principal amount on their mortgages when homes are under water.  BUT the person must be current on their mortgage.<br/>
<br/>
Facing reality gives one the opportunity to plan to mitigate the worst outcome.  You can apply for low cost housing, the foreclosure process can take some time, especially if you are in a state where the lender must go to court.  But if you cannot make the payments, the heartless banks will foreclose.  They have to.

								We fell a month behind almost immediately after we bought our house due to unexpected health problems which occurred while we we waiting for loan approval.  The lender would only accept full payments, no partials - say, if it's the beginning of July and I have the previous (June) payment and half of the next month (July), the lender would not take what I sent them - they wanted us to wait until we could send in two complete payments.  I actually had funds returned by them (one was a personal check and another time it was cash I'd wired to them) because the payments were not quite the full amount due.  I'd sent them anyway, thinking that something was better than nothing and certainly more attractive than falling further behind.  This has been happening for quite some time, and now we're facing foreclosure.  We've spoken with friends &amp; associates, none of whom have ever heard of any lending/payment practices such as this - not accepting less than the full amount due.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone here ever encountered this ?  At this point, it sounds like because we were first-time homebuyers and apparently quite naive, we should have questioned this a while ago.  We'd thought that this was how all mortgage lenders worked - but now we find that maybe it's not us but them ?  Are there lenders that would rather wait, for example, for two complete payments instead of taking the one and a half we sent ?

<br/>
I wish to inform you that your loan agreement governs your contract. Now generally the debtor can pay a partial amount also and can specify that the payment is to be applied towards debt. However, in case your agreement specifically mentions that payment will be of whole amount and not less then the agreement provisions will be followed. For this agreement should have specifically mentioned this fact that part payment cannot be done. Further, in case you send part payment then also you will remain liable for the unpaid portion of the installment. <br/>

While it may be unusual for a mortgage company to reject a payment that is less than the total amount due, they have absolutely no obligation to accept it either.  Mortgage companies are now less likely to accept partial payment if there is a history of outstanding payments or payments of less than the full amount when due.   <br/>
<br/>
In these days of economic troubles, it is more important than ever to keep in contact with the lender and actively communicate with them if there is an issue.  They will let you know what their policy is regarding partial payment, and will advise whether or not it is a good idea to even try making one.

When a lender rejects payments, they intend to foreclose. Once a mortgage becomes more than 30 days in default, as many mortgages are written, the lender may refuse to accept payments.<br/>
<br/>
The custom has been ""30 days"" they report it. ""60 days"" they send it to their legal department in anticipation of foreclosure. ""90 days"", the mortgage is officially in default and they do not accept any more payments.

</div>
</div>
</div>The Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 signed into law on Wednesday, May 20th, 2009 (Pub. L. 111–22) provides a 90-day  notice requirement and additional protections for tenants in foreclosed properties. <br/>
<br/>
Here are the major provisions outlined under Title VII, Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act of 2009.<br/>
<br/>
 - During the term of the lease, the tenant has a right to remain in the unit and cannot be evicted, except for actions that constitute good cause.<br/>
<br/>
- If the lease ends in less than 90 days, the new owner may not evict the tenant without giving the tenant at a minimum 90 days notice.<br/>
<br/>
- At the end of the term of the lease, the new owner may terminate the tenancy if the new owner provides a 90-day notice.<br/>
<br/>
- The new owner may terminate the tenancy if the owner will occupy the unit as a primary residence, and has provided the tenant a notice to vacate at least 90 days before the effective date of such notice. This is the only exception to the rule that the tenant may not be evicted during the term of the lease.<br/>
<br/>
These provisions expire on December 31, 2012.<br/>
<br/>
The only part I'm not sure of, is as the deadline above approaches, whether or not the law will be extended any further, or what happens to leases that are not scheduled to expire until AFTER the deadline.

</div>
</div>Any new owner would have to honor the lease, including the lender who takes the house back.  The foreclosure process can be prolonged, depending upon the state you live in and whether they foreclose judicially or non judicially.  In New York state the judicial foreclosure process can take as long as three years.  In Florida, the average is 2 years.  All depends upon whether the person contests the foreclosure process, too or just allows the case to go to default.<br/>
<br/>
As long as the lease is signed prior to foreclosure it should be valid against the lender for it is an encumbrance against title. <br/>
<br/>
What lenders have been doing when they obtain title to a house, there are tenants in possession, is sometimes offer ""cash for keys,""   In other words, come up with cash to get the tenants to leave voluntarily.  Should the house go to foreclosure, the bank should prefer to have someone in the house making payments rather than have it sit empty, subject to vandalism and decay.<br/>
<br/>
As long as you pay and do not violate the terms of a lease, you should be fine remaining for the term of the lease.

I wish to inform you that rent will be paid to the owner of the building. The owner is paid till the time foreclosure procedure does not change owner or untill you do not receive order from court. You can ask  property management company to obtain court order in order to have rent. If you are having a fixed lease then you cannot be evicted by new owner after foreclosure. <br/>

</div>With the case number, you should be able to get access to the court file. Follow up with the court clerk. You are entitled to know who now owns the house and to whom you are to pay rent. Without that information you are in the dark, as you know. I would not pay the management company until they provide you proof of the new owner and that they are managing for same. Living in Florida you are aware there are many scams being run around foreclosed homes -- and also foreclosures that have not stood a legal test. While not implying that is the case here, it is just prudent to get the proof of who the new owners are and that the management company is acting for them.<br/>
<br/>
As long as rent is paid, you are entitled to remain in the house until given notice as the law requires to vacate.  As to any new owners, the notice you got is that the house is going up for auction on 5/29 Z(today).  It may not sell.

While not implying that is the case here, it is just prudent to get the proof of who the new owners are and that the management company is acting for them.<br/>
<br/>
As long as rent is paid, you are entitled to remain in the house until given notice as the law requires to vacate.  As to any new owners, the notice you got is that the house is going up for auction on 5/29 Z(today).  It may not sell.

I wish to inform you that after foreclosure bank becomes owner and sell the house to a new buyer. In this regard if foreclosure is complete then new buyer must have got the property and new buyer is your present landlord. You can ask landlord to produce title documents to claim rights of a landlord and show premises. If by any reason your old landlord is still the owner then he must be having title documents. <br/>

I wish to inform you that little relief is provided under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention Consumer Protection Act effective as on October 17, 2005 in case of eviction after foreclosure. However, these provisions apply only to tenants who have “lost” in a state court eviction proceeding and who are facing a “judgment for possession”. Further, Chapter 258 of the Acts of 2010, “An Act Relative to Mortgage Foreclosures” provides protection to tenants living in foreclosed properties.<br/>

								Hi my family has been hit really hard this year it is a very long story please help!! my name is Sheena <br/>
<br/>
My question is pretty long….<br/>
Our mortgage went through three differant banks franklin, concord, and then wells fargo. Well, we went into foreclosure and just gave up didn\’t fight..Our house sold at a sheriff sale for way more than the amount we paid. It sould to HUD housing I believe and for the amount of $72,811.93 When we paid only $58,686.00 back in 2006..??!! So, it seems weird taht it sold for that amount of money to HUD? So, then exactly one day before court for the eviction I find out about MERS. I went down to the deeds office in hastings mi and pulled our papers and our home is a mers case…Found an attorney that went to court with us for free and asked Trott and Trotts attorney to provide the legal note/deed by the end of the day. Well, I called the attorney and he said he gave Trott till the next day…So I called the next day, and he basically told me to take the money and run and move…? Then, I read more about mers as there was a cover story on our towns paper the next day…SO, I called the deeds office and both ladies myself and the state is now totally confused…The attorney that help us seems bothered by the whole deal now I really dont think he wants to bother with it as it is so new and such a biggie…<br/>
wells fargo did offer us cash for keys in the amount of $1400.00 but they will not release the money till May 16th when they inspect to make sure we are completly out of our home.<br/>
So, is there any hope?<br/>
I have been in the process of claiming social security disability due to numerous issues one of which is called Mixed connective Tissue disease its like Lupus and RA. Anyway, its been 2 years on my own and 9 months with an attorney trying to win my case. My case is now in between Battle Creek and Lansing to be reviewed for the Administrative Judge. So, I am hopeing that this will all go through so we dont have to live with family or worst on the streets. Moving is going to be very tough on us because of my illness and money and as good as $1400.00 sounds we would almost rather stay here so we dont have to keep living in fear and we have 2 weeks to move if we settle with wells fargo and not push this mers. I really dont knwo what to do???!!!!<br/>
We could not make the house payments due to my illness. I am no longer able to work and keeping up with my medical issues. I have to keep up with doctors and medications so I am feeling descent enough to give my all to my daughter and husband, is all I am able to do. This is very hard times for my family and if MERS isnt allowed to foreclose on our home than that would be good for us. And, buy us some time to possibly be able to afford our payments or find a rental…At this time our finances are so tight and DHS is only able to help so much.<br/>
As if this isnt bad enough, our michigan taxes are being garnished for over $1,000.00 and our taxes are to help us with rent if we do have to move out.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I also read that this MERS is being investigated by the FBI, is that true?<br/>
I am really in need of finding someone that can really help me!!<br/>
Any advice you can give to me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

								Re: Foreclosed under MERS, please help. Already had sheriff sale...<br/>
<br/>
Hi Sheena,<br/>
<br/>
First off, I am not a lawyer.  I want to pass on information that aired on Channel 7 News Detroit last Wed.?<br/>
Here is the link with the video.  The reporter says All Homeowners who have MERS are to see a Judge ASAP to get these Foreclosures Reversed and All Evictions must be Canceled.  There is an Emergency Seminar (Free) that is set up Tomorrow, May 2nd at 5920 Second Avenue, Detroit, MI  It Starts at 6pm.<br/>
<br/>
This is all in response to the Michigan Supreme Court findings against any foreclosures having to do with MERS.  (April 21, 2011)  My understanding is that MERS did not/could not assign both the Title to your home AND the Loan...they could only assign the loan.  This means the legal title (Deed) remained and remains in your name and your obligation is now an UNSECURED debt.  This means IF you owe money they CANNOT take your home.  If in fact the Trustees are legal owners they personally have to sue you, I think, but none-the-less, a NEW Foreclosure if ever brought again will have to be done judiciously.  In front of a Judge, not by Advertisement...(No signs slapped on your door)<br/>
<br/>
I just want to send this info to you and the lawyer who was on the news is Jerry Goldberg.  I think he will be informing people exactly what they have to do to stop your foreclosure and eviction.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.  There was another news story breaking this news on the Grand Rapids, MI news.  Google it too....Good Luck.  P.S...Can we Please get some Foreclosure Lawyers for the HOMEOWNERS to show up in Michigan and Help us File?  This Supreme Court Ruling echos Mass., New York, All from the Board of Governors revue and their sending their Cease and Desist Order to MERS. (2 weeks ago)  Sheena, I think your house is worth more than $1,400....just sayin'  <img alt="""" border=""0"" class=""inlineimg"" smilieid=""1"" src=""https://forum.legaljunkies.com/core/images/smilies/smile.png"" title=""Smile""/>
</div>, <div class=""js-post__content-text restore h-wordwrap"" itemprop=""text"">
							
								
								Re: Foreclosed under MERS, please help. Already had sheriff sale...<br/>
<br/>
I think you should consult a Foreclosure Lawyer immediately so that your concerns are legally acknowledged.  Best regards.
							
						</div>, <div class=""js-post__content-text restore h-wordwrap"" itemprop=""text"">
							
								
								Re: Foreclosed under MERS, please help. Already had sheriff sale...<br/>
<br/>
The biggest hurdle recovering the home is that it is has been sold. If it were a MERS transaction odds are that the lender or HUD does not have the note and mortgage and therefore cannot prove they own the loan.<br/>
<br/>
Further, the NY Attorney General has sued B of A over all their MERS transactions claiming they did not comply with NY Trust and securities law the way they were made. Not that B of A's MERS transactions were any different than all the other lenders--just that they are the biggest of the banks.<br/>
<br/>
If your lawyer intends to challenge the MERS transaction, there are two cases already won on the illegality of the way MERS transferred property., One in Kansas and the other in Alabama. The Alabama case is La Salle. I will supplement with the cite later. But it seems if he takes on the process MERS used as violative of NY Trust and Securities statutes, you have a leg up on defeating the lender and keeping your home. I am not an attorney, but a paralegal who has been following these cases and others since I am working as a consumer advocate with homeowners like you similarly cheated and run over by the big banks. Wells Fargo is under investigation by all 50 states' attorneys generals for its practices making home loans and was recently fined $85 million by the FDIC for its predatory practices the past nine years.

Was the house judicially foreclosed? Or non judicially? That is important regarding stopping the sale. Please email me up right away for we may be able to help.

Well, we went into foreclosure and just gave up didn\’t fight..Our house sold at a sheriff sale for way more than the amount we paid. It sould to HUD housing I believe and for the amount of $72,811.93 When we paid only $58,686.00 back in 2006..??!! So, it seems weird taht it sold for that amount of money to HUD? So, then exactly one day before court for the eviction I find out about MERS. I went down to the deeds office in hastings mi and pulled our papers and our home is a mers case…Found an attorney that went to court with us for free and asked Trott and Trotts attorney to provide the legal note/deed by the end of the day. Well, I called the attorney and he said he gave Trott till the next day…So I called the next day, and he basically told me to take the money and run and move…? Then, I read more about mers as there was a cover story on our towns paper the next day…SO, I called the deeds office and both ladies myself and the state is now totally confused…The attorney that help us seems bothered by the whole deal now I really dont think he wants to bother with it as it is so new and such a biggie…<br/>
wells fargo did offer us cash for keys in the amount of $1400.00 but they will not release the money till May 16th when they inspect to make sure we are completly out of our home.<br/>
So, is there any hope?<br/>
I have been in the process of claiming social security disability due to numerous issues one of which is called Mixed connective Tissue disease its like Lupus and RA. Anyway, its been 2 years on my own and 9 months with an attorney trying to win my case. My case is now in between Battle Creek and Lansing to be reviewed for the Administrative Judge. So, I am hopeing that this will all go through so we dont have to live with family or worst on the streets. Moving is going to be very tough on us because of my illness and money and as good as $1400.00 sounds we would almost rather stay here so we dont have to keep living in fear and we have 2 weeks to move if we settle with wells fargo and not push this mers. I really dont knwo what to do???!!!!<br/>
We could not make the house payments due to my illness. I am no longer able to work and keeping up with my medical issues. I have to keep up with doctors and medications so I am feeling descent enough to give my all to my daughter and husband, is all I am able to do. This is very hard times for my family and if MERS isnt allowed to foreclose on our home than that would be good for us. And, buy us some time to possibly be able to afford our payments or find a rental…At this time our finances are so tight and DHS is only able to help so much.<br/>
As if this isnt bad enough, our michigan taxes are being garnished for over $1,000.00 and our taxes are to help us with rent if we do have to move out.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I also read that this MERS is being investigated by the FBI, is that true?<br/>
I am really in need of finding someone that can really help me!!<br/>
Any advice you can give to me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Hi Sheena,<br/>
<br/>
First off, I am not a lawyer.  I want to pass on information that aired on Channel 7 News Detroit last Wed.?<br/>
Here is the link with the video.  The reporter says All Homeowners who have MERS are to see a Judge ASAP to get these Foreclosures Reversed and All Evictions must be Canceled.  There is an Emergency Seminar (Free) that is set up Tomorrow, May 2nd at 5920 Second Avenue, Detroit, MI  It Starts at 6pm.<br/>
<br/>
This is all in response to the Michigan Supreme Court findings against any foreclosures having to do with MERS.  (April 21, 2011)  My understanding is that MERS did not/could not assign both the Title to your home AND the Loan...they could only assign the loan.  This means the legal title (Deed) remained and remains in your name and your obligation is now an UNSECURED debt.  This means IF you owe money they CANNOT take your home.  If in fact the Trustees are legal owners they personally have to sue you, I think, but none-the-less, a NEW Foreclosure if ever brought again will have to be done judiciously.  In front of a Judge, not by Advertisement...(No signs slapped on your door)<br/>
<br/>
I just want to send this info to you and the lawyer who was on the news is Jerry Goldberg.  I think he will be informing people exactly what they have to do to stop your foreclosure and eviction.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.  There was another news story breaking this news on the Grand Rapids, MI news.  Google it too....Good Luck.  P.S...Can we Please get some Foreclosure Lawyers for the HOMEOWNERS to show up in Michigan and Help us File?  This Supreme Court Ruling echos Mass., New York, All from the Board of Governors revue and their sending their Cease and Desist Order to MERS. (2 weeks ago)  Sheena, I think your house is worth more than $1,400....just sayin'  <img alt="""" border=""0"" class=""inlineimg"" smilieid=""1"" src=""https://forum.legaljunkies.com/core/images/smilies/smile.png"" title=""Smile""/>

I think you should consult a Foreclosure Lawyer immediately so that your concerns are legally acknowledged.  Best regards.

<br/>
The biggest hurdle recovering the home is that it is has been sold. If it were a MERS transaction odds are that the lender or HUD does not have the note and mortgage and therefore cannot prove they own the loan.<br/>
<br/>
Further, the NY Attorney General has sued B of A over all their MERS transactions claiming they did not comply with NY Trust and securities law the way they were made. Not that B of A's MERS transactions were any different than all the other lenders--just that they are the biggest of the banks.<br/>
<br/>
If your lawyer intends to challenge the MERS transaction, there are two cases already won on the illegality of the way MERS transferred property., One in Kansas and the other in Alabama. The Alabama case is La Salle. I will supplement with the cite later. But it seems if he takes on the process MERS used as violative of NY Trust and Securities statutes, you have a leg up on defeating the lender and keeping your home. I am not an attorney, but a paralegal who has been following these cases and others since I am working as a consumer advocate with homeowners like you similarly cheated and run over by the big banks. Wells Fargo is under investigation by all 50 states' attorneys generals for its practices making home loans and was recently fined $85 million by the FDIC for its predatory practices the past nine years.

Was the house judicially foreclosed? Or non judicially? That is important regarding stopping the sale. Please email me up right away for we may be able to help.

I want to refinance it, the lender is saying that she, my wife, has to sign her name to the deed/mortgage and that it is a state law.

Well, you have to put in mind, when considering home mortgage refinancing, it is important to know what variables can affect the refinance rate received. Each factor can have as much as a full percentage point's difference in the new mortgage interest rate, that's according to various mortgage experts. Remember that when you are equipped with knowledge, you can approach your own home mortgage refinancing with greater assurance. To know more about this, look at:<br/>

								We have been attempting to refi our home at a reduced interest rate since October of last year wth BOA. On the first attempt, after submitting all the requested paperwork, we received a notice indicating that because they did not have all the necessary paperwork to follow through, they were not going to refi and closing the account. I contacted the agent I was dealing with and he told me that he had no idea why this was occuring admitting all necessary paperwork was received in a timely fashion. He appologized and indicated that we would have to start the process all over, and after talking to his supervisor, we would be offered a reduced interest rate in addition to BOA paying some of the closing costs because of the inconvience it caused us.<br/>
<br/>
We began the second attempt in Janurary, submitting additional paperwork as requested, even though we were receiving packages from them on a monthly basis requesting paperwork that we have proof has been submitted. This refi has changed hands, in house about 7 times, due to people leaving or being moved to different departments and each time we have to start all over with the new person. Recently we received info that the interest rate is higher than what we were originally offered back in October, and before we were promised a reduced rate because of the problems we've encountered because of BOA. And we have heard nothing as to what closing costs they will pay that we were promised. We still have no idea of a closing date. Their appraiser under appraised our house value and there are several mistakes on his report that can be verified on the property appraisers site. I'm told that to get this corrected, I have to research several properties that are for sale or sold in our area as proof of the mistakes. The appraiser works for Landsafe, which is a company owned by BOA. As a matter of fact, we had to send them a letter of explanation as to why there were credit checks against us over the past few months(requesting info on refi's from other banks) with one of the companies being Landsafe, which is BOA. Can they be sued for putting us through all this aggravation and misrepresentation of what what originally promised based upon our credit check? I have excellent credit!

Bank America is one of the banks that has agreed to make refinance available under certain circumstances to its customers -- part of the $25 billion dollar settlement they entered into with the federal government to escape prosecution or at least civil suit. Dancing people around, putting them through hoops, 'losing papers' or 'never receiving' them is part and parcel of the ploy lenders have been using to stay, stall and run people up against and into foreclosure. Bad faith is a kind word for it. The modification turn down rate has been 99.1% of all applications submitted to the big bank lenders, so do not feel like the only person they have done this too.<br/>
<br/>
There are attorneys who concentrate on foreclosure defense and dealing with lenders like BankAmerica which is what I suggest you apply to. Somehow they seem to sit up and pay attention when a lawyer shows up for their pigeon -- the way they treat their customers. They have skilled lawyers so a customer needs one, too, especially when the issue is their home and possible loss of it. An attorney who has a foreclosure defense practice is also up on the strategies to defend against the banks, as many as 150 defenses to a mortgage and/or foreclosure, and also should be up on the recent developments to settle with mortgage holders (victims).

								Refi in 2007 of 1st and 2nd mortgage with Citimortgage. They had the orignial mortgage signed by both my wife and I ,also both names are on the deed. However durning the 07 refi only I signed the paperwork to complete the transaction. Since then my wife and I have seperated and she moved out to live with an older son of ours. No seperation agreement or divorce is in effect. Now I went to refi again to lower the interest rate and all was good until the title co called. They claim that her signature is necessary to get the new mortgage or her name be removed from the deed. Neither of which will happen. What is my recourse?  Thank you.

								Re: Title co error (?) -- Refi in 2007 of 1st and 2nd mortgage with Citimortgage<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that as original transaction started with your wife signature thus now her signature will be required. In this transaction your wife is a party to the transaction and thus her consent is required. Any change in the terms of contract requires consent of all the parties. You may have now refi without consent of your wife if she is not part of refi agreement. In this as second refi was done without consent of your wife thus you may argue that contract with your wife has ended at that time and second refi for which you require change of terms of contract is only between you and bank thus consent of your wife is not required.  <br/>

Someone messed up in 07.  If the mortgage was in both names as is the house (because you're not saying you got the refi in your name alone, they just failed to have her sign off?)  she must sign.

</div>
</div>There may be a lot more at stake than the current ""get her signature on the new mortgage.""  <br/>
<br/>
Going back to the '07 refinance:  If the wife did not sign the mortgage papers, that mortgage may be invalid.  Most states require that BOTH spouses sign the mortgage documents in order for the mortgage to be valid.

								Refi in 2007 of 1st and 2nd mortgage with Citimortgage. They had the orignial mortgage signed by both my wife and I ,also both names are on the deed. However durning the 07 refi only I signed the paperwork to complete the transaction. Since then my wife and I have seperated and she moved out to live with an older son of ours. No seperation agreement or divorce is in effect. Now I went to refi again to lower the interest rate and all was good until the title co called. They claim that her signature is necessary to get the new mortgage or her name be removed from the deed. Neither of which will happen. What is my recourse?  Thank you.

								Re: Title co error (?) -- Refi in 2007 of 1st and 2nd mortgage with Citimortgage<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that as original transaction started with your wife signature thus now her signature will be required. In this transaction your wife is a party to the transaction and thus her consent is required. Any change in the terms of contract requires consent of all the parties. You may have now refi without consent of your wife if she is not part of refi agreement. In this as second refi was done without consent of your wife thus you may argue that contract with your wife has ended at that time and second refi for which you require change of terms of contract is only between you and bank thus consent of your wife is not required.  <br/>

Someone messed up in 07.  If the mortgage was in both names as is the house (because you're not saying you got the refi in your name alone, they just failed to have her sign off?)  she must sign.

</div>There may be a lot more at stake than the current ""get her signature on the new mortgage.""  <br/>
<br/>
Going back to the '07 refinance:  If the wife did not sign the mortgage papers, that mortgage may be invalid.  Most states require that BOTH spouses sign the mortgage documents in order for the mortgage to be valid.  There are cases all over the country where one of the spouses did not sign the mortgage and the mortgage was declared void -- the person got the mortgage lien off their title and the property free and clear.<br/>

I wish to inform you that if you are behind in your mortgage payments then you should not ignore the problem. If you receive a letter from your lender, you must open it and respond to it. Your failure to read the documentation received from a lender will not serve as an excuse in the foreclosure court. You may contact the State Government Housing Office and learn about your mortgage rights. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides funding for free or very low-cost housing counseling nationwide. The housing counselors can help a person understand the law and the options with the person to organize the person's finances. Further HUD may represent a person in negotiations with a person's lender, if the person needs this assistance. You may contact the HUD-approved housing counselor near you for guidance. Finally, you should safeguard yourself from foreclosure recovery scams.<br/>

								If a lender forecloses a property they are holding a mortgage on, and the proceeds do not cover the debt, can they foreclose or put a lien on other properties the debtor(s) own? Can a lender on an unsecured debt, such as credit card debt, put a hold or lien on the debtors property?

								Re: Lender going after other property<br/>
<br/>
If the proceeds from a sale do not cover the outstanding debt the note holder can seek a deficiency judgment.  This judgment can be executed by placing a lien on the debtor's other assets.  This is relatively rare, but there is nothing stopping the bank from doing it.  <br/>
Credit card companies will not typically pursue delinquent accounts.  They sell the debts to debt collectors for pennies on the dollar.  The debt collector then will pursue collection.  The debt collector can sue you for the debt then place a lien on your property.  Whether they will do this depends on the size of the outstanding debt and your assets. <br/>
If both of the creditors seek enforcement of the debts chapter 7 or 13 bankruptcy is a viable option.  Additionally, in negotiations with the creditors you can use the threat of declaring bankruptcy as settlement tool. <br/>

I wish to inform you that you have availed the $8,000 tax credit in 2009. Now, if you sell the house within 3 years of ownership then you will need to refund the complete amount of $8,000 to the IRS. The house was purchased in September 2008 and only after September 2011 will 3 years will have elapsed after availing the tax credit and you will not need to refund the complete amount of $8,000 to IRS. If you sell the house prior to September 2011 you will need to refund the amount to IRS. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 is applicable to the years 2007 to 2012. In this, the amount of debt to be forgiven must be reported on Form 982 and this Form 982 must be attached to the tax return.<br/>

								You only have to repay if you have a gain on the sale.

I am facing a possible foreclosure after 2 years, so I have researched this extensively. I'm sure this will bring a snarky comment about how I am a low life or some such similarly useless observation. <br/>
Basically, the government just wanted to make sure unscrupulous people couldn't ""flip"" the property for a profit AND benefit from the tax credit. The payback requirements take into account that sometimes things happen beyond our control even though we have the very best of intentions.<br/>
Now, that said, if you do happen to make a profit, then you do, rightly so, have to pay back the credit up to the amount of your gain. For example, a gain of $ 2000 on the sale would mean a repayment of $ 2000 to the government due payable on the tax return of the same year as the sale of the property. Hope this helps and good luck.

								My brother passed away in July 2011 in Michigan. The heirs decided not to take posession of his house as the mortgage is more than the value of the home in this declining market. The probate papers clearly state that the estate is intitled to the propane in the tank which is full. The house has been winterized by the bank but the 6 month time is not completed for it to be sold. The propane company refuse to pump the tank to settle the small $100.00 outstanding balance as they say the propane belongs with the house. I think we are still entitled to this as the house doesn't even hit the 6 month late on payment until February.<br/>
<br/>
The propane was listed inthe probate to offset the bill of the funeral that I assumed. The supervisor of the Amerigas location won't return my calls to try to fix this. We gave the bank the keys as soon as we had the house cleaned out so that they wouldn't have to prolong the process. I believe the gas company is holding out trying to sell the gas to the new owner (thus getting paid twice for the same gas). Is there a way to place a dispute against the property or stop the Feb. 8th sale until this is resolved.

I wish to inform you that you can obtain a stay order from court. In this regard you can file a lawsuit in court whereby you may demand that the propane must be provided to you as per will. In this regard as by sale of house your propane may be lost thus you request court that the effect of sale of house will result in irreparable damage to you and so an injunction from sale of house must be granted till your propane dispute is not decided by court. <br/>

The ex-boyfriend set up the paperwork like this to avoid paying gift taxes for this house.  He has never collected any money from my sister in the 10 year period and it is now 13 years since she has been there.  He has suddenly shown up at her door telling her that she has to pay him $60,000 or move out in 3 months.  He has promised in the past to sign a discharge of mortgage paper, but always backed out of it.  Can he still take the house away from her when he never collected in the entire 10 years of the mortgage agreement?  It is now three years later and he seems to think he can simply get her out.  What remedy does she have in this situation?

I wish to inform you that it is the terms of the agreement and the Statute of Limitations of the state in which the house is situated or the state in which the agreement was signed will have jurisdiction in this matter. If the time period as stated in the Statute of Limitations has elapsed, then your sister may serve a reply to the other party that the debt is time barred and no payment is due from her any further. If the other party takes the matter to court then your sister may inform the court that the other party has not made any effort to collect the debt or take the matter to court in the past 13 years, therefore, the debt is time barred.<br/>

								My sister has owned a home given to her by her ex-boyfriend for the last 13 years.  He set up a front mortgage that was to be paid off by her in 10 years.  The ex-boyfriend set up the paperwork like this to avoid paying gift taxes for this house.  He has never collected any money from my sister in the 10 year period and it is now 13 years since she has been there.  He has suddenly shown up at her door telling her that she has to pay him $60,000 or move out in 3 months.  He has promised in the past to sign a discharge of mortgage paper, but always backed out of it.  Can he still take the house away from her when he never collected in the entire 10 years of the mortgage agreement?  It is now three years later and he seems to think he can simply get her out.  What remedy does she have in this situation?  Does the fact that he never made any effort to collect by himself or with the help of the court in the mortgage agreements 10 year period make a difference?

								Re: Home given as gift with mortgage<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that it is the terms of the agreement and the Statute of Limitations of the state in which the house is situated or the state in which the agreement was signed will have jurisdiction in this matter. If the time period as stated in the Statute of Limitations has elapsed, then your sister may serve a reply to the other party that the debt is time barred and no payment is due from her any further. If the other party takes the matter to court then your sister may inform the court that the other party has not made any effort to collect the debt or take the matter to court in the past 13 years, therefore, the debt is time barred.<br/>

								In October/November 2009 I began to try to refinance or modify my home mortgage with Wells Fargo. We were instructed to fax in documents to paint an accurate picture of why we need  the modification. In January I was sent a letter outlining terms for a trial payment plan to be executed for four months. The letter states that at the end of the term, we would be evaluated for a permanent refinance. Our payments were reduced by about $500 per month. We have faithfully paid each month. In May, my husband called Wells Fargo to see about our next payment. He was told that Wells Fargo tried to get in touch with us (our phone has been out) and since they were unable to, we were taken out of the program and we would have to apply all over again, though they were able to see that we would have been approved in the computer if they had gotten a hold of us in time. That's the first weird thing. I was instructed to send everything in again, and continue to make the smaller payment.<br/>
So, earlier this month I sent everything in again. Today hubby calls and speaks to someone who says that our loan was actually put in a short sale program. WTF? No one ever told us that! I have no intention of selling my home if I can get the payments lowered. The customer service person told my husband that a lot of that was going on at Wells Fargo, the employees were making a commission for putting loans in this program, and they have since been fired. I do not even know where to go from here. My mind is totally blown by this. If this is true (I don't know how I would verify it) I would like to know what steps I should take now.<br/>
My husband was instructed to call back to give specific details on our $ situation over the phone tomorrow to be evaluated again for a modification program. <br/>
Any advice is appreciated.

Based on what you say here, you could file suit against them (or at least threaten to do so) in small claims court or in regular court; filing in small claims court is easier and requires no attorney...you could try to collect all of the costs and damages that you suffered due to their behavior... You may also report them to your state attorney general's office.

								I and my family rent a house in Mississippi in June 2011. Can my landlord cash my (earlest money) check before I sign  a lease agreement? The bank came to us last week stating that they got the procession of the property and offer us with the moving and leasing option. At that momment I was speakless and in a stage of shot because the landlord never mention anything to us. So I stop the check I wrote to him for Oct rent because I was PISSED!!!!. I asked the bank who do I paid for Nov rent and they said to no one yet until I make decision of what to do. My land came to the house and stated that I own him for Nov  rent and if I don't paid he will take me to court. I paid $1800 for security deposit and last month rent of $1800 and pet deposit $300. Since the landlord default the lease and the bank took over my last month rent should cover for Oct rent. He stated that he still own the house and willing to let us paid rent for $900 a month starting Dec til my lease end. But he stated that he will cancel the lease and all of the utility have to be in his name we would be his quest leaving there. I don't trust him and he have lost my trust. The bank stated that 3 of property was foreclosure last year.

								Re: Mississippi: Can my landlord keep my security deposit and last month rent?<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that landlord can have security deposit only to claim any loss caused by breach of contract. In this regard you may inform landlord that no loss have been caused to landlord because of breach of contract by you and thus he cannot force you to pay rent of November. You may send a demand notice demanding all the amount due to you. If you are leaving the premises because of breach by your landlord then this thin may be specifically mentioned in your demand notice. If your landlord refuses then a lawsuit can be filed in court. <br/>

								I understand that filing a Certificate of Acknowledgment, Certificate of Authority, and a copy of the Warranty Deed perfects the deed and gives the homeowner first lien position with a lawful deed, also known as good title.

I wish to inform you that in the case of a warranty deed the seller guarantees that the seller holds a clear title to the property and can sell the property to the buyer. The guarantee given by the seller is not from the time the buyer owned the property but from the time of the origin of the property. Whereas, the warranty deed is a legal document used to transfer full legal title to another person on the other hand, the deed of trust creates an interest of the beneficiary in the property.

In the papers I was served today, it also lists me as the mortgagor along with him.

I wish to inform you that you may request the mortgage company for a copy of the mortgage contract so that you can verify and ascertain the true parties to the mortgage contract. If you have been tricked into the mortgage contract by your ex-boyfriend then you may issue a written notice. If the other party does not resolve the matter, then you may file a lawsuit. You may self represent yourself or seek guidance from Legal Aid to reduce the cost of the litigation. The court will consider all the facts and decide the matter.<br/>

If you were not on the mortgage and note, you cannot be foreclosed upon. You have an absolute defense to the foreclosure. If you did not sign the mortgage and note, your interest may be a complete stopper to the foreclosure.<br/>
<br/>
Forget the 'quit claim' deed or signing any other document., Until you have met with a real estate lawyer for a consultation. People in similar situations have ended up owning a property free and clear of the mortgage -- because they never signed the note and mortage -- only their partner.

								re: Paying Loans at closing of your home -- Long Island, N.Y.<br/>

I wish to inform you that your loan agreement and sale agreement will determine your liability. In this if you had undertaken loan in your name then you are liable on the loan. If loan is transferred on sale then you are not personally liable and new buyer will be liable. As at present your lawyer had just sold the house but transfer of loan to new buyer was not done thus you are still liable on the loan. The sale of house is similar to short sale where seller will get released only if it was agreed before short sale. <br/>

Where did you have it escrowed? If you sold the house and the terms of the earnest money agreement were that you were to deliver a warranty deed free and clear, there should have been a title search and the line of credit shown if it was a second mortgage on your property,.<br/>
<br/>
Whoever escrowed the deal should have paid it off at closing. Escrow agencies have errors and omissions insurance and from what you describe this is a BIG error and/or omission. You may well have a claim against the escrowing company, be it a bank, attorney or title company --no matter.<br/>
<br/>
I would see a real estate attorney, bringing him your earnest money and closing papers plus the collection letters. If you got a copy of the preliminary title report, that is probative.

								I live in Michigan.  I have a 1st mortgage that was used to purchase the home and a 2nd mortgage that was used for siding for the same house. I turned in my resignation at a previous employer and have since moved out of my primary residence.   I told my mortgage companies that I was unemployed after my previous employer let me go after turning in my resignation.  I have not made any payments to the primary or secondary mortgage company.  I haven't heard much from the primary mortgage company but the secondary has been very vocal including continuing to call.  I understand why they are calling.  They want their money.  However, I can't afford to pay for two places of residence and the associated utilities.  We were starting to get behind on a lot of payments that weren't just limited to mortgages so I knew something had to change anyway.  It just so happened it was me moving out due to a job located in a another part of the state.<br/>
<br/>
I am attempting to do a short sale.  We currently don't have a buyer or even potential buyer.  The house has been on the market for about a month now.  The secondary mortgage holder just now sent some paperwork to the realtor and is looking for personal information such as my income, my current employer, my assets(including retirement accounts), and my expenses.  The secondary mortgage holder won't even talk to my realtor until I fill out this paperwork.  In figuring out my initial income an expenses, I come up with about $400 extra each month.  I am not sure where but that's what the budget says.  I have deferred student loans that will be due starting in 6 months.  I also have a 401k with about $30,000 in it.  The secondary mortgage holder has already said they will seek a deficiency.  The primary mortgage company has said they will not.<br/>
<br/>
Now on to my questions.  If I list my income, expenses, and assets including my 401k, will the primary and secondary mortgage companies see this as me having sufficient funds to pay something on both mortgages?  Can either mortgage company legally force me to use my 401k money?  Do these companies have reasonableness guidelines for expenses?  I am not living in the lap of luxury or have a yacht or anything but I do have $170 cable/internet/phone bill and a $270 four person cell phone bill.  I support a family of four on a single income and I may not have the best money management skills but I know that we are living paycheck to paycheck with no emergency fund.  The secondary mortgage company also wants a hardship letter with plans on how I plan to cover the deficiency.  I can give the hardship letter but I have no idea what to put down for a plan as I don't currently have one.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

<br/>
I wish to inform you that your income and assets may be taken into account for evaluation whether the amount of loan may be recovered or not. In this generally as 401k is an exempt item thus may not be recovered from you. Further you may inform 2nd mortgagor that as your resources do not allow payback, thus, short sale may be best options. <br/>

<div class=""message"">I live in Michigan. I have a 1st mortgage that was used to purchase the home and a 2nd mortgage that was used for siding for the same house. I turned in my resignation at a previous employer and have since moved out of my primary residence. I told my mortgage companies that I was unemployed after my previous employer let me go after turning in my resignation. I have not made any payments to the primary or secondary mortgage company. I haven't heard much from the primary mortgage company but the secondary has been very vocal including continuing to call. I understand why they are calling. They want their money. However, I can't afford to pay for two places of residence and the associated utilities. We were starting to get behind on a lot of payments that weren't just limited to mortgages so I knew something had to change anyway. It just so happened it was me moving out due to a job located in a another part of the state.<br/>
<br/>
I am attempting to do a short sale. We currently don't have a buyer or even potential buyer. The house has been on the market for about a month now. The secondary mortgage holder just now sent some paperwork to the realtor and is looking for personal information such as my income, my current employer, my assets(including retirement accounts), and my expenses. The secondary mortgage holder won't even talk to my realtor until I fill out this paperwork. In figuring out my initial income an expenses, I come up with about $400 extra each month. I am not sure where but that's what the budget says. I have deferred student loans that will be due starting in 6 months. I also have a 401k with about $30,000 in it. The secondary mortgage holder has already said they will seek a deficiency. The primary mortgage company has said they will not.<br/>
<br/>
Now on to my questions.

</div>
</div>First, your second mortgager holder is way, way out on a limb behind the first lien holder and has no right whatsoever to your financial information.  If you do not pay your first, they will foreclose and the 2nd mortgage holder will get nothing.  Unless they pay off the first.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are under water on the house, the mortgages totalling more than the property is worth -- and considering a short sale suggests that you are -- I would not give the second mortgage holder any personal information except  -- that you are considering a short sale and will get back to them if there is any excess after paying the first.  Any financial information you give they can only use against you -- assess your weakened status at this time.  It is not in your best interests to give them such information.  <br/>
<br/>
No lender can force you to use your 401K, either.  You would benefit from some credit counseling -- by a non profit agency -- not the ""we will pay your bills, negotiate with your creditors"" for profit company for many of these take your money and do not pay the creditor -- leaving one in worse position.  <br/>
<br/>
Your biggest concern is with your first mortgage holder.  If they agree to a short sale, you will need to get a ""without recourse"" agreement as part of the language in the sale to the new buyer so they cannot come after you for any deficiency.

								Hi<br/>
I got the lawsuit paper work from the mortgage companyo n june 27th; I have 20 days to reply to the court but I can not affort an attorney at this point.<br/>
I thought about not to reply to the lawsuit and let the house go; I had been tryng to work it out with the bank but they are not open to anything, but there is something on the papaer that said ""future income"" my guess is the bank is requesting to get from me any money that I can make in the future. So base on that piece of information; do I need to reply to the court and explain my situacion? It will not save the house but maybe it will save my future income?<br/>

It is best to respond but your financial situation is not going to stop anything unless the bank wants to work with you. Still best to be there and know what is going on.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Experienced foreclosure investors may work in various stages, but the possibility of making a transaction with the house owner is no longer possible after the property is an REO. We deal with REO properties. Thus you need not bother about the previous owner here! To know more log on to: <br/>

								Re: Do I need to reply to the court on a foreclosure?<br/>
<br/>
Because so many are currently facing foreclosure, this post is worth answering again for those in the same situation. YES, it is important to answer a suit for foreclosure and do so within the 20 day time period. Not on the 21st day, either. But by the 20th day. <br/>
<br/>
Many of the banks do not have the proof they own the loan and have any right to foreclose in the first place. So answering the suit, making them prove every element of their claim, and that they have the note and mortgage or it was properly assigned can only work to one's best interests. If one defends against foreclosure they may find the bank making them an offer to settle rather than go to trial, 'modify' the loan, 'cash for keys' and what is most important if one wants to let them have the property, not fight, make sure they stipulate not to go after a deficiency judgment. For with a judicial foreclosure, once a lender goes to court to get the property, in most states the lender can also get a deficiency judgment against the homeowner. That means for 10 years the lender can go after the homeowner's bank accounts and assets for the difference between what is owed and what they got for the property. In Florida, deficiency judgments are good for 20 years. <br/>
<br/>
So just 'letting them have the property', not answering and defending can have horrendous consequences in the future.

</div>You need to have specific ""no recourse"" language in the documents you sign with the bank which in effect says they are accepting the short amount they are getting on your loan and will have no further recourse against you [the deficiency]/

<br/>
The rule has been that unless there is a judicial foreclosure a lender may not collect a deficiency,  However, the letter you have should assure they will not go after for the shortage if they accept the short sale.<br/>
<br/>
Considering the tactics most of the major lenders have resorted to the past few years -- which have them under investigation for fraud by all 50 states' attorneys general, your wariness is understandable.<br/>
<br/>
There's an offbeat way of dealing with your concerns, however.  And that's a deed in lieu of foreclosure.  If you have a pending sale, the buyer and lender will have to go along with it.  In essence what it would mean your assigning your interest in the pending earnest money and sale agreement to the lender, executing a deed in lieu of foreclosure to the lender and let the lender close the deal then as owner.  A real quick REO owned property that sells in escrow.,<br/>
<br/>
Deed in lieu of foreclosure was a remedy often used before this current mortgage crisis and the 'mod', 'trial mod', 'short sale' series of hoops mortgagors jump through before eventually losing their home.  It's a walk away -- just giving the property to the lender and the lender has no recourse to come after one years later.<br/>
<br/>
Check this out with a real estate lawyer in your state would be my recommendation since laws vary from state to state.

I just got an email back from my realtor...<br/>

<br/>
What they told her in a sense is that they can't issue such a document, because they have MIP on the loan i.e. they get paid from HUD from what I understand (m'I correct ?)<br/>
They can't waive a HUD deficiency and according to:<br/>

HUD won't file a deficiency unless there is a fraud (which is OK with me).<br/>

So my question is could this be true. Once I finish PreForeclosure short-sale the bank can't file deficiency judgment, only HUD can AND they will file such thing only if there is fraud involved ?<br/>

</div>HUD does not go after individual borrowers unless there is fraud involved.  I stand by my original answer.  If you do a deed in lieu of foreclosure to the bank, it then becomes the bank's property and sale.  HUD can look to the bank for they will be the one who sold it short, not you.

								Re: HUD Pre-Foreclosure Sale and Deficiency Judgment<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, I'm skeptical.  I've been researching the HUD statement you referenced and it seems clear from the wording that HUD is not the one who pursues the deficiency judgment.  They say specifically, <br/>
<br/>
""The Department has already begun requesting or requiring<br/>
mortgagees to obtain deficiency judgments in instances where the<br/>
mortgagors are non-occupant owners; have previously defaulted on one<br/>
or more FHA-insured mortgages resulting in the payment of claim(s);<br/>
or are ""walkaways,"" having abandoned their mortgage payment<br/>
obligations despite their apparent continued ability to pay.""<br/>
<br/>
 ""The Department has already begun requesting or requiring<br/>
mortgagees to obtain deficiency judgments"" <br/>
<br/>
This part makes it clear that the ""mortgagee"" is the one to obtain the deficiency judgment (the mortgagee being the holder of your loan.)  Furthermore, at the end of this statement, it says, <br/>
<br/>
""Please note that only where pursuit of the deficiency judgment was<br/>
requested or required by the Department, or where HUD has approved a<br/>
mortgagee's request for permission to pursue a judgment, will the<br/>
expenses connected with this action be reimbursable when the claim is<br/>
filed.""<br/>
<br/>
So the statement was made to say that mortgagees will only get reimbursed for obtaining a deficiency judgment when fraud was involved.  Which implies that mortgagees may choose to obtain a deficiency judgment even when fraud isn't involved.  The government has nothing to say about that unless the state forbids it.  <br/>
<br/>
So depending on Nevada's laws (I don't know them) the bank may still come after you.  You said that your bank claimed it couldn't waive the right to obtain a deficiency judgment on a FHA loan.  That may be true, but notice they DID NOT specifically say that they wouldn't come after you if fraud wasn't involved.  <br/>
<br/>
Beware, I can only take the fact that they didn't explain that to you to be a sign that they wish to keep that right for the future.  Maybe modifying the loan would be a better choice, but you should also beware of legal groups that say they will help you get out of your foreclosure scott free.  With the current laws and predatory behaviors by legal entities, it seems unlikely there is any ""quick fix"" to this situation many people find themselves in.  <br/>
<br/>
I suggest you research everything you don't completely understand, check several sources, read all fine print and get advice from someone who has knowledge of this system and no interest in deceiving you.  Good luck.

								I'm in the final stage of Pre-Foreclosure short-sale (Nevada).<br/>

It is not clear exactly what this mean ? at least for a layman person.<br/>

So my question is can the bank file  ""deficiency judgment"" against me after the short-sale is done.<br/>

I'm asking because I would rather go to foreclosure and then bankruptcy, rather than waiting 6 years for a surprise.<br/>

She is also a heavy drinker and will not move as alcohol is prohibeted in assisted living environment.  She says she plans on staying there untill the banks force her out......meaning she has no intention of paying mortgage.  Her last refinance was in Jan of 2010, so there is no equity in the home.  When she dies all she will leave behind is debt.  My concern is she will go through foreclosure process.....rack up court costs etc. with no means to pay for it.

								I'm paying the mortgage but IRS says I can’t write off interest on taxes.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Flordia and I bought a piece of property with a friend of mine. Both of our names are recorded on the deed. He secured a mortgage in his name only but we are splitting the mortgage payment in half. In order for me to deduct half of the mortgage interest on my taxes, the IRS says that I need to be legally liable for the loan. Can we write some simple contract or promissory note between each other that will satisfy the IRS?

I wish to inform you that as you have paid the creditor thus under principal you will enter the shoes of creditor and will have all the rights of creditor. If whereabouts of other grantor are not known from last 24 years then you may take orders from court whereby you must be allowed necessary rights to protect your financial  interest. In this the court documents may be delivered through substituted service as address of grantor is not known. <br/>

<br/>
If the other grantor is not known for the past 24 years you can take the ground of presumption of death, presumption of death means if a man is not known continuously for the last 7 years and by establishing that after required search no information of the particular person existence is received, he is presumed to be died. So in the particular case upon evidence of his non existence and a court order upon the facts you will be considered to as the sole Grantor.

I wish to inform you that your foreclosure fact can be removed. If VA has paid all the loan then you may write this fact to credit reporting agency and may ask  them to remove foreclosure. Credit reporting agency will then ask your creditor and will investigate your claims. After investigation if credit rating comes to conclusion that there was no foreclosure because of default then it may be removed. As your loan was VA loan and VA had paid all the amount therefore you may claim that amount was paid by VA so this fact should be removed. <br/>

So, I completely understand that the landlord, as long as they own the property can collect rent. <br/>
<br/>
My landlords have defaulted on their home, the one I'm renting, as of Aug 08, 2011. I have the Notice of Default from the County Assessor, it's public information...I got suspicious when I started receiving the landlords mail: Wells Fargo, Trustee Service, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I paid August rent but I havn't paid September...I told the landlord I would like to speak with them and we're meeting this weekend.  I have a month-to-month lease and I have been living here for 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to attempt to negotiate these last two months rent... If I pay for September and move in Oct they will lose October's rent and have to return my 1900.00 security deposit so they'll be out $3800. I am going to propose they keep my security deposit of $1900 and $500 for Sept and $500 for Oct. That is $2900 they would gain if I stay. A win-win situation : )<br/>

I wish to inform you that your lease can be terminated by you by giving a notice. In this you may enter into an agreement with the lessor about amount of rent. You can know about the owner from property registry. The property registry will inform you name of the person on ownership documents. If there is a change of ownership then rent may accrue towards new owner provided new owner informs you about his claim. You may discuss with the new owner possible reduction in rent amount or any other bargaining which you may like to have. Rent accrues towards the person who is acting as your landlord.<br/>

The assignments are not evidence of current ownership.  Not with the current state of affairs over the electronic transfers through a system called M.E.R.S.Mortgages were assigned (sold) multiple times in some cases and there has been conflict over which bank owns a particularly property.  <br/>
<br/>
Until you receive a decree of foreclosure granting deed to one bank or another, the landlord is the only owner that you have knowledge of and you continue making payments to the landlord.<br/>
<br/>
In foreclosure, a tenant has rights to remain in the property up to 90 days and/or a bank must pay relocation costs, ""cash for keys"" if the tenant holds his ground.

								I entered into foreclosure in 2008 on my house. The house was foreclosed and sold in 2008 by the bank to a new owner. On my credit report, both the 1st and 2nd were charged off as bad debt.

It was my understanding that the second mortgage was a non-recourse loan because I live in California under the California Code of Civil Procedures section 580b, therefore allieviating me from the debt tied to this unfortunate outcome.

								Re: CA-2nd Mortgage Non-Recourse<br/>
<br/>
You are correct that in California one can obtain a deficiency judgment after foreclosures and sale on one to 4-unit residential dwellings.   But that is for first mortgages only.<br/>
<br/>
However, loans taken out after the home was purchased through a refinance or second mortgage can be subject to a deficiency judgment IF all the following conditions are met:<br/>
<br/>
1. The lender forecloses under judicial proceedings <i>(California Code Civil. Proc. § 726).</i><br/>
<br/>
2.  There is a 3-month limit for actions for deficiency judgments under a judicial foreclosure.<br/>
<br/>
3.If the second mortgage is hard money and the lender has lost  security for that loan through a foreclosure or short sale -- making the  security for the promissory note worth nothing -- the beneficiary of  that second mortgage <b>can</b> pursue a deficiency judgment <i>(Roseleaf Corp. v.

I wish to inform you that your friend may obtain help for stay on foreclosure. In this regard, her husband's health by itself may not stay the foreclosure proceedings. If she intends to avoid foreclosure then she may opt for loan modification or reinstatement or refinancing. Foreclosure is for recovery of defaulted loan and thus may not be stopped on health issues of spouse. She may apply for the Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program (EHLP). She may approach a HUD-approved housing counseling agency for a loan under the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan (HASP). She may contact HUD at (800) 225-5342 for guidance and assistance. <br/>

It states on the ""Multiple Offer"" form that ALL ""best &amp; final"" offers needed to be submitted by 10pm on 7-24-2011. We had ours submitted &amp; waited for the bank and listing agent to determine who had the highest offer. We then heard back that our offer was ACCEPTED. We then waited for the listing agent to send over the contract to sign. We signed the contract &amp; sent over our earnest money to the listing agent on 7-29-2011. Although the contract was signed the listing agent messed up on amount of money the seller (the bank) was going to pay on closing costs. On 8-4-2011 at 8pm our agent calls to inform us that they are putting the house back on the market because there were multiple calls to the government regarding the home not being on the market long enough?? How is this legally possible if we have a signed contract??? It shouldn't matter how long a house is on the market if someone has the money &amp; wants it right??

I wish to inform you that normally the houses are auctioned off in a public event. In this case, it appears you made a bid and as it was declared the highest bid it was accepted. You have signed the contract but you have stated that the agent has messed up on the closing costs and the house was put up again for sale. Herein, if on account of the fault of the agent you have not closed the contract correctly then the bank may rescind the contract and the property may be put up for sale again. You will need to study the provisions of your contract as they will govern in the subject matter. There is a possibility to file a lawsuit against the agent if the agent has been negligent in the performance of duties entrusted to the agent.<br/>

								Hi, thank you for taking the time to read my message.<br/>
<br/>
We started the morgage with Cyprus bank on the 30th- 06th- 2007. When we began we were given paper work stating that we had to pay 663.85 euros a month/ 450 sterling for 24 months and then our morgage was to be increased to 1036.51 euros / 695 sterling per month after that. Three and a half years later, ( the last time we went to Cyprus) we were informed that we were undercharged from the beginning and even though it was their fault we had to pay them 16,000 euros which they expected us to pay, on top of the 1,200 euros a month that we had to pay for the morgage, every other month. The Manageress of the  Paralimni branch made it sound that we would loose our property if we did not, and she was arrogant enough to say that it was only a grammatical error that created this situation and we should have been aware that the price we were paying was unrealistic! she also said that if we did not agree in paying it back in the period of six months (5,000 every other month) and up the monthly payments from 1200 to 1,850 a month also,we would have our property confiscated. also she had said, when we asked why they had not let us know before hand of this discrepancy,  that they had sends us correspondence about it. my husband insisted that she checked that out and when she did she discovered that they had send the correspondence to the wrong address, but most importantly she insisted that we signed new papper work otherwise we stood to loose our property.<br/>
<br/>
 First and foremost it was not just a grammatical error, because i had asked the lady who dealt with us originally to write the payments down for me so as i would not make a mistake and she did so on the front of the legal paper work that she gave us. Which i still have!<br/>
<br/>
We were railroaded by the manageress to sign new contracts there and then( we were coming home that day) otherwise she was going to pass our situation on to the receivership department! <br/>
<br/>
I have been up to date with any payments they asked for, and we have all ready paid ??£5,000 out of the 16000 euros they have asked from us. but when i checked the original morgage details i realised that there was no mistake. Simply the bank had given us a morgage agreement that at the end of its duration it left 50.000 outstanding which was to be dealt with at the end of the morgage agreement. For some reason the bank did not wish to honour that deal after three and a half years had gone by. That was one year ago. I have been sending the morgage payments to them but have not send any more moneys for the so called arrears. Last week a man, 'Pavlos', called from the bank and requested to fax us the ''new arrengement'' they had kindly put together for us in order that they help us with the arrears! i send him the following message back: <br/>
<br/>
Pavlos, i have just received a message from my husband at work and i must tell you that the only deal i will be happy with is the original deal that cyprus bank made with us in the very beginning. Why you offered us that deal and now are telling us we cannot have it i don't know but i promise you i will find out. My husband and i took on this morgage, only because the original deal you offered us made it possible for us to be able to afford this morgage through out its duration with out pressurising our commitments in england. We cannot afford to sent 2000 euros a month to you,before honouring any other costs over there and all our commitments in England. We would never had committed our selves to this morgage on top of our commitments in england if we knew that Cyprus bank would try to change their agreement with us, and may i say in such an underhanded fashion as the Paralimni branch manageress has done. We cannot except the slanderous!  accusation that we owe  Cyprus bank any moneys. Unacceptable. A complete fabrication of the facts by your selves to achieve your sole purpose of taking from us the original deal you gave us and replacing it with what i presume suits the establishment now! I have attached the original contract  with this   email    to you. This was  what we had agreed with your representative at the time,to be the deal we would have with Cyprus bank. What i would like for you to do is examine the attachment and show me according to our original contract where you can see any monthly payments not being accurate through out the three and a half years Cyprus bank took these payments from us. And on every one of our visits  we came to the bank and not once were we told we owered    any moneys. The new contract was falsely forced on to us. I will not even go in to how much stress and uneasiness Cyprus bank has caused us over this. I will not even stress how i have resorted to medication in order  that i am able to deal with this fiasco. I will however be expecting to see in writing from you based on our original morgage and i mean the original where there is money owered. I have all the original contracts paper work. Furthermore whatever your reasons for falsifying information in order to change the original deal you offered us are irrelevant because we expect Cyprus bank to honour their original contract and therefore, we see any other documents that have been completed and signed under false pretences non valid . In addition i would like to know wether Cyprus bank followes the european law as you are part of the eu. I will need to see why Cyprus bank does not want to honour their original agreement with us.<br/>
<br/>
In return i have received a letter from them today specifying that if we did not pay the arrears imediately they will be terminating our contract and will be expecting full payment of the full amount of the morgage. <br/>
<br/>
I dont know what to do. I feel we need to take it to court, but the expence will leave us in a very uncomfortable possition. However if i knew that we are in the right and the law will justify us then i would go ahead and fight.Do you consider that we have a valid case or are we basically in it up to our necks. Please advise. <br/>
<br/>
Kindest regards  totsis1.

								re: Mortgage issues with holiday home abroad -- Cyprus bank, England<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that your mortgage agreement governs your right. In this bank cannot unilaterally change terms and conditions. When your husband was informed about charges not levied from beginning then he may refuse for levy of that charge as that was not agreed. You and your husband may write to bank that you cannot be forced to sign new agreement as you never agreed to new terms and conditions. If any term was left then that is fault of bank and 5,000 euros paid can be demanded back. You may give your legal position in writing. If bank does not agree then they will start lawsuit for default in which you can present to court correct legal position that you are not at fault. You can self represent in court and may reduce costs. <br/>

Dear AFF, i am so grateful for your swift and helpful response.

Three and a half years later, ( the last time we went to Cyprus) we were informed that we were undercharged from the beginning and even though it was their fault we had to pay them 16,000 euros which they expected us to pay, on top of the 1,200 euros a month that we had to pay for the morgage, every other month. The Manageress of the  Paralimni branch made it sound that we would loose our property if we did not, and she was arrogant enough to say that it was only a grammatical error that created this situation and we should have been aware that the price we were paying was unrealistic! she also said that if we did not agree in paying it back in the period of six months (5,000 every other month) and up the monthly payments from 1200 to 1,850 a month also,we would have our property confiscated. also she had said, when we asked why they had not let us know before hand of this discrepancy,  that they had sends us correspondence about it. my husband insisted that she checked that out and when she did she discovered that they had send the correspondence to the wrong address, but most importantly she insisted that we signed new papper work otherwise we stood to loose our property.<br/>
<br/>
 First and foremost it was not just a grammatical error, because i had asked the lady who dealt with us originally to write the payments down for me so as i would not make a mistake and she did so on the front of the legal paper work that she gave us. Which i still have!<br/>
<br/>
We were railroaded by the manageress to sign new contracts there and then( we were coming home that day) otherwise she was going to pass our situation on to the receivership department! <br/>
<br/>
I have been up to date with any payments they asked for, and we have all ready paid ??£5,000 out of the 16000 euros they have asked from us. but when i checked the original morgage details i realised that there was no mistake. Simply the bank had given us a morgage agreement that at the end of its duration it left 50.000 outstanding which was to be dealt with at the end of the morgage agreement. For some reason the bank did not wish to honour that deal after three and a half years had gone by. That was one year ago. I have been sending the morgage payments to them but have not send any more moneys for the so called arrears. Last week a man, 'Pavlos', called from the bank and requested to fax us the ''new arrengement'' they had kindly put together for us in order that they help us with the arrears! i send him the following message back: <br/>
<br/>
Pavlos, i have just received a message from my husband at work and i must tell you that the only deal i will be happy with is the original deal that cyprus bank made with us in the very beginning. Why you offered us that deal and now are telling us we cannot have it i don't know but i promise you i will find out. My husband and i took on this morgage, only because the original deal you offered us made it possible for us to be able to afford this morgage through out its duration with out pressurising our commitments in england. We cannot afford to sent 2000 euros a month to you,before honouring any other costs over there and all our commitments in England. We would never had committed our selves to this morgage on top of our commitments in england if we knew that Cyprus bank would try to change their agreement with us, and may i say in such an underhanded fashion as the Paralimni branch manageress has done. We cannot except the slanderous!  accusation that we owe  Cyprus bank any moneys. Unacceptable. A complete fabrication of the facts by your selves to achieve your sole purpose of taking from us the original deal you gave us and replacing it with what i presume suits the establishment now! I have attached the original contract  with this   email    to you. This was  what we had agreed with your representative at the time,to be the deal we would have with Cyprus bank. What i would like for you to do is examine the attachment and show me according to our original contract where you can see any monthly payments not being accurate through out the three and a half years Cyprus bank took these payments from us. And on every one of our visits  we came to the bank and not once were we told we owered    any moneys. The new contract was falsely forced on to us. I will not even go in to how much stress and uneasiness Cyprus bank has caused us over this. I will not even stress how i have resorted to medication in order  that i am able to deal with this fiasco. I will however be expecting to see in writing from you based on our original morgage and i mean the original where there is money owered. I have all the original contracts paper work. Furthermore whatever your reasons for falsifying information in order to change the original deal you offered us are irrelevant because we expect Cyprus bank to honour their original contract and therefore, we see any other documents that have been completed and signed under false pretences non valid . In addition i would like to know wether Cyprus bank followes the european law as you are part of the eu. I will need to see why Cyprus bank does not want to honour their original agreement with us.<br/>
<br/>
In return i have received a letter from them today specifying that if we did not pay the arrears imediately they will be terminating our contract and will be expecting full payment of the full amount of the morgage. <br/>
<br/>
I dont know what to do. I feel we need to take it to court, but the expence will leave us in a very uncomfortable possition. However if i knew that we are in the right and the law will justify us then i would go ahead and fight.Do you consider that we have a valid case or are we basically in it up to our necks. Please advise. <br/>

Kindest regards  totsis1.

								re: Mortgage issues with holiday home abroad -- Cyprus bank, England<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that your mortgage agreement governs your right. In this bank cannot unilaterally change terms and conditions. When your husband was informed about charges not levied from beginning then he may refuse for levy of that charge as that was not agreed. You and your husband may write to bank that you cannot be forced to sign new agreement as you never agreed to new terms and conditions. If any term was left then that is fault of bank and 5,000 euros paid can be demanded back. You may give your legal position in writing. If bank does not agree then they will start lawsuit for default in which you can present to court correct legal position that you are not at fault. You can self represent in court and may reduce costs. <br/>

Dear AFF, i am so grateful for your swift and helpful response. But just so that i understand you correctly, even though we were made to sign new paper work one year ago, because this was done under false pretenses we can insist the bank Honor their original contract with us and reimburse any additional charges that we have had from them due to this event?

								We are currently going through a foreclosure in the state of Washington with adate of sale on February 4, 2011. We had been paying our HOA dues up until December, and then stopped because we thought the condo would be sold. It has since been delayed and we received notice from our HOA that we owed back HOA dues and if we didn't settle up they would hire an attorney to recoup the funds. Are we responsible until the bank takes possession? What happens if we don't pay the fees. Thank you for your responses.

I wish to inform you that laws of your state laws will govern HOA claims. Generally HOA can have a lien on the condo and in foreclosure sale HOA dues will also be paid. The owner of the premises is liable for HOA dues therefore you are liable till your are owner of the premises. Generally when a home is foreclosed on, all junior liens are wiped out, including liens for unpaid HOA. <br/>

I have seen this news that talks about foreclosure issues. In the news they have mentioned that  an individual's credit reliability is dependent upon lots of variables, most of which could be controlled in one way or another. What state an individual resides in, however, can't be manipulated short of moving somewhere else. A brand new study rates all fifty states in order of their creditworthiness. I think one factor that really affects bad credit is being unemployed because how can you be able to pay all those debts if you don't have money, right? <br/>

								Our house went into foreclosure and we got the summons/notice last November.  It was filed in October 2010.  The foreclosure case was 'dismissed' in December when our bankruptcy case was filed with Bank of America's right to reopen once our bankruptcy was dismissed/discharged/etc.  The bankruptcy was discharged March 29, 2011, and here we are almost four full months later and BoA has <b>not</b> reopened their case (not that we're complaining, though we're a bit confused as to why).  I contacted the clerk of courts today to ask if it had been reopened without our knowledge even though our bankruptcy lawyer had assured us BoA would notify us.  The clerk confirmed it was still closed and there were no open cases against us so we're still waiting on that.<br/>
<br/>
My question I guess is... is there a specific amount of time between a bank filing with the court and when the judgment is handed down?  Our lawyer had said that once they do reopen the case it will automatically pick up from where they left off, so when it got halted it was just over 2 months into the process.

</div>No, there is no specific time a court may dismiss a case, foreclosure or any other civil, for failure to prosecute the claim by the plaintiff or for a plaintiff to reopen one.  <br/>
<br/>
So far, you have a reprieve.  Keep on top of the docket in this case which you may be able to do online if your county maintains online dockets.  You should be notified if BofA reopens the case, though, by personal service or certified mail. <br/>
<br/>
Once they do, however, you WILL need to be represented by an attorney to put up a defense to the foreclosure.  <br/>
<br/>
I might mention that in Wisconsin a lender may elect to choose non judicial foreclosure, too.  If BofA so chooses, they may just send you notice that your property is foreclosed upon and the date of the sale.  <br/>
<br/>
In either event, you will need an attorney to halt the foreclosure or sale.  With the irregularities such as electronic sales of mortgages where the current holders of the mortgage do not have the original note and mortgage, to forgery of documents for foreclosure, to violations of federal and state statutes in the overwhelming majority of the 60 million plus loans made the past nine years, an experienced real estate and foreclosure/mortgage defense attorney can defeat many of these mortgages should the matter go to trial.

								Re: surprised by 24 eviction notice (tenant of foreclosed home, florida)<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that you can show fault of bank in obtaining court order. In this regard generally eviction suit is file after which writ of possession is given. As bank has not served eviction lawsuit documents on you therefore you had never come to know that other party is involved in eviction process. Bank is also required to give an eviction notice before filing Complaint. Chapter 83 of Florida Statutes deal with tenancy. You may show that bank has obtained writ of possession by playing a fraud upon the court. <br/>

<span style=""color:black"">From the facts it seems that bank has approached the court without clean hands. It seems bank has obtained the writ of possession by misleading the court. It seems that as an existing tenant your rights to be protected. As per </span>THE PROTECTING TENANTS AT FORECLOSURE ACT OF 2009 90 days notice is mandatory if the new LL wants the rented building for any genuine purpose. As an existing tenant it is the duty of the Bank to inform you the proceedings before the court, which they did not. Therefore the eviction procedure adopted by the bank is per se illegal and arbitrary. It is better advised that you may consult with a Property Attorney who can give a proper guidance in this regard

								Re: surprised by 24 eviction notice (tenant of foreclosed home, florida)<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that you can show fault of bank in obtaining court order. In this regard generally eviction suit is file after which writ of possession is given. As bank has not served eviction lawsuit documents on you therefore you had never come to know that other party is involved in eviction process. Bank is also required to give an eviction notice before filing Complaint. Chapter 83 of Florida Statutes deal with tenancy. You may show that bank has obtained writ of possession by playing a fraud upon the court. <br/>

<br/>
<span style=""color:black"">From the facts it seems that bank has approached the court without clean hands. It seems bank has obtained the writ of possession by misleading the court. It seems that as an existing tenant your rights to be protected. As per </span>THE PROTECTING TENANTS AT FORECLOSURE ACT OF 2009 90 days notice is mandatory if the new LL wants the rented building for any genuine purpose. As an existing tenant it is the duty of the Bank to inform you the proceedings before the court, which they did not. Therefore the eviction procedure adopted by the bank is per se illegal and arbitrary. It is better advised that you may consult with a Property Attorney who can give a proper guidance in this regard

<br/>
Thank you very much for the replies. Based on what I've read &amp; heard, it does seem their actions directly conflict with the PTFA.  I've gathered my documents &amp; proof of receipts by the realty group &amp; will be first in line at the Broward court house with my affidavit &amp; motion. I must have spent over 5 hours Saturday night just reading on every possible scenario &amp; rights of a tenant. Needless to say, I'm still on edge, with minimal sleep &amp; knots in the belly.

I wish to inform you that private registered setoff bond can be sett of your mortgage if bank is ready to accept such a thing. In this regard government issued bonds may generally be accepted but private bonds do not enjoy such value. You may ask bank regarding the fact that can they agree for setoff of mortgage on private registered bonds.

i wish to inform you that if your daughter has become a co-debtor then she is liable for the amount of mortgage. In this regard for bank the loan has been provided to your daughter and her boyfriend because both the parties appear in loan document. Ownership of premises may not be the condition of loan for your daughter. in this your daughter can be removed from the loan agreement by making a new agreement with bank. However if your daughter makes any payment then she can recover that amount from her boyfriend as benefit of that payment has been received by her boyfriend. <br/>

A mortgage is generally obtained by a home owner who has an outstanding  debt or is taking a loan out from a bank or other qualification operated  establishment. The mortgage acts through a coin of collateral that is  held on to by the lender or bank that grants the mortgage to the home  owner.

In order for your daughter to be liable for the mortgage debt she would have had to have obligated herself on the loan with the mortgage company, like submitting her credit information to the lender and co-signing the mortgage papers.  <br/>
<br/>
She needs to get an order from the court allowing her to pick up her personal property.  She will have to prove ownership of the appliances and other effects in the house by affidavits (yours, too, about purchase of the appliances for her) and whatever receipts she has.

</div>You need legal representation and by a lawyer who is a real estate and foreclosure expert.

There are instances where a lawyer has been able to stop an auction just a couple of days before.

You have no time to waste. You can save your house from foreclosure, but for that you have to sweat a little bit. You have to go to the court and convince the court, the reason behind the foreclosure. If you could prove that you were suffering from mental illness during the initiation of foreclosure proceedings, then no doubt court will interfere with the foreclosure proceedings. You have file for a TRO temporary restraining order. It is better advised that  you may consult with a Property Attorney dealing with Foreclosure matters ASAP and initiate legal steps according to his/her advice.

I have since lost my job, house is in foreclosure.  I have accepted a short sale offer on the house and provided all necessary docs (contracts, financials, etc) to the lenders.

								Re: Short sale deficiency... Am I liable for any deficiency balance?<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that in bankruptcy you have not reaffirmed any of your debts. You can be held liable only if your debts are reaffirmed. In this regard when you are making payments so that you can live in the house then you may claim that payments by you were similar to that of rent payment and were not aimed at reaffirmation of loan account. In reaffirmation of loan account the aim of parties is to have the debt outside bankruptcy and you may show that particular debt was taken in bankruptcy and therefore will not be in reaffirmation of debt. <br/>

								Re: Short sale deficiency... Am I liable for any deficiency balance?<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not you are liable for deficiency will depend upon the papers you sign at closing on the short sale. You would have to be sure there is ""NO RECOURSE"" language in the documents, stipulating that the bank will accept the sales price and have no recourse against you for the difference. Otherwise banks can and have gone after people for the deficiency between what the place was sold for and the initial mortgage balance. They can do this years after, when one is back on their feet and/;or has assets to go after; paycheck, another piece of real estate. In Florida it can be as long as 20 years later.<br/>
<br/>
It behooves you to have legal counsel review your closing documents to assure the language necessary to protect you is included. Or, even better for many, have knowledgeable counsel represent you to restructure the loan instead of sell if you wish to keep the property.

I have since lost my job, house is in foreclosure.  I have accepted a short sale offer on the house and provided all necessary docs (contracts, financials, etc) to the lenders.  Am I liable for any deficiency  balance since I never re-affirmed the loans?

								Re: Short sale deficiency... Am I liable for any deficiency balance?<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that in bankruptcy you have not reaffirmed any of your debts. You can be held liable only if your debts are reaffirmed. In this regard when you are making payments so that you can live in the house then you may claim that payments by you were similar to that of rent payment and were not aimed at reaffirmation of loan account. In reaffirmation of loan account the aim of parties is to have the debt outside bankruptcy and you may show that particular debt was taken in bankruptcy and therefore will not be in reaffirmation of debt. <br/>

								Re: Short sale deficiency... Am I liable for any deficiency balance?<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not you are liable for deficiency will depend upon the papers you sign at closing on the short sale. You would have to be sure there is ""NO RECOURSE"" language in the documents, stipulating that the bank will accept the sales price and have no recourse against you for the difference. Otherwise banks can and have gone after people for the deficiency between what the place was sold for and the initial mortgage balance. They can do this years after, when one is back on their feet and/;or has assets to go after; paycheck, another piece of real estate. In Florida it can be as long as 20 years later.<br/>
<br/>
It behooves you to have legal counsel review your closing documents to assure the language necessary to protect you is included. Or, even better for many, have knowledgeable counsel represent you to restructure the loan instead of sell if you wish to keep the property.

								re: How do I get a line of credit on a house I just purchased?<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that you may go to bank or financial institution and may take line of credit for the value of your house. In this regard you may discuss with the bank that you are ready to pledge the house against a line of Credit. As house is without any debt therefore you may pledge it even if house is present in other state and house can be marked with registry office regarding lien. It is not necessary for you to live if you intend to give house as security to bank. <br/>

								Re: I have rental property that I have not been able to keep up the payments on.<br/>
<br/>
From the facts it could understand that you have a rental property which is mortgaged and you couldn’t keep up the payments on. Generally when a property is mortgaged the mortgagor has to pay off the debt to the mortgagee. Once the debt is cleared the mortgagee will clear the title. Here you have not cleared the mortgage debt, so it seems that the mortgage company is not liable to clear the original title. It is better advised that you may consult with Property Attorney who can give a proper guidance in this regard.

He's living in the house but let the mortgage slide, and the bank foreclosed and sold it at auction in January. According to the court, however, this is an illegal sale because the property had not gone through the probate process. If indeed the auction sale was illegal, does the auction buyer get his money back? Is the property owned free and clear by my brother in law? What happens?

I wish to inform you that if the house has been sold then court order may be taken to regard the sale as void. In this as the process taken by bank is not correct therefore bank can be held liable to compensate the buyer. The bank can foreclose property only legally and any sale without following provisions of law is a void sale and is therefore a nullity. In this the court order that sale is void may be taken and property ownership may be taken by legal heirs. The buyer of the house is not having any title from a void sale but can have compensation from bank for unjust enrichment taken by bank. <br/>

								hello, my name is amanda. i am indonesian citizen. in 1983-1984 my father had apartment loan in singapore. he had paid an advance of more than 50% from the apartment price. but, unfortunately my father's business went bankrupt and he became depressed. we were leaving singapore and went back to indonesia. soon my father became very ill. we simply abandoned the apartment. my father failed to pay off the mortgage. and we never told the bank about his difficulty and i was a kid at that time. now the bank had been auctioning off the apartment without our knowledge, maybe because the bank did not know our address in indonesia. <br/>
<br/>
my question is Is there any change of refundable advances within singapore law about our case???<br/>
<br/>
thank you so much for your attention and i am looking forward to hear from you soon.

								Re: refundable advances of mortgage<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that if your father was owner of the apartment then you may have claim to sale price after deduction of all amount due to creditors. In this regard, you may issue a notice to the bank asking for the amount of refund due to you after the loan amount was paid. If the bank fails to provide the details and resolve the matter then you may file a lawsuit. The court will consider all the facts and resolve the matter.<br/>

I wish to inform you that in foreclosure firstly the amount will be paid to th 1st mortgage and then to second mortgage and after all loans and costs are paid the rest of the money will be paid to you. In this regard you may protect yourself either by showing that there exists clauses in contract which protect you or which show that amount is not due. You may also opt for short sale. <br/>

I wish to inform you that the second mortgage holder may perform the foreclosure. In this, the money from the new buyer will be applied towards first mortgage and then the balance will be paid to the second mortgage. In this regard for the remaining money the second mortgage company may ask from you as an unsecured creditor. The right to ask for the loan amount of the second mortgage holder remains untill whole amount has been paid.<br/>

								My wife and I are going through a divorce. We have no children but own a house together in California that I agreed to let her keep. She has been living there since we separated in Oct. 2006. The divorce is going to be finalized in Sept. of this year and the divorce papers state that she must refinance by the end of July in her name only. I recently found out that she is having a hard time refinancing due to her credit situation. If she is in fact unable to refinance where does that leave me? If the house goes into forclosure will my credit be ruined for the next 7 years or will the court automatically obsolve me of the mortgage responsibilty if she does not refinance by the time the papers say that she must?

								I live in WI. Foreclosure proceedings began on my home in July 2009. In April 2010, my family and I moved from our house into an apartment about 3 blocks away. We did a major move of furniture and necessities over a weekend, then were gradually moving the rest of our things as we had time. On May 17th, we went to the house and discovered a letter from the bank and an eviction notice from the sherriff's dept on the door. We believed we were no longer allowed to enter the house even though we still had items there. The letter from the bank instructed the sherriff's dept to notify us of the eviction, remove our things from the house and put them into storage. About 2 weeks later, a truck came and removed our items from the house, including a non-working vehicle that we were arranging to have towed. We received this news from a former neighbor. We never received copies of the eviction notice, letter from the bank or word of where our items were taken or how we could retrieve them. My questions are, 1: Were the items still considered our property at the time they were taken from the house or were they considered abandoned? 2: If they were still ours, who can I contact to find out where our things are? 3: If they are stored somewhere, are we liable for the cost of all the months of storage, even though we weren't given the opportunity to remove the items?<br/>
Any help is appreciated!<br/>
Thanks!

								re: Property left in foreclosed home - WISCONSIN<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that as things taken belonged to you, therefore, you are still the owner of those items. In this regard, you may demand your things from your creditor who took possession after foreclosure. In case the bank refuses or does not inform the where abouts of your goods then you may claim compensation. Ownership in property belongs to you and therefore you may claim rights to your goods. Along with the eviction notice a lawsuit may have been filed and lack of service of documents to you seriously affects your rights. In this, you may challenge the order of court. However, you will have to pay storage charges for your goods. Wisconsin Statutes 799.45 deals with the subject.<br/>

The letter from the bank instructed the sherriff's dept to notify us of the eviction, remove our things from the house and put them into storage. About 2 weeks later, a truck came and removed our items from the house, including a non-working vehicle that we were arranging to have towed. We received this news from a former neighbor. We never received copies of the eviction notice, letter from the bank or word of where our items were taken or how we could retrieve them. My questions are, 1: Were the items still considered our property at the time they were taken from the house or were they considered abandoned? 2: If they were still ours, who can I contact to find out where our things are? 3: If they are stored somewhere, are we liable for the cost of all the months of storage, even though we weren't given the opportunity to remove the items?<br/>
Any help is appreciated!<br/>
Thanks!

<br/>
I wish to inform you that as things taken belonged to you, therefore, you are still the owner of those items. In this regard, you may demand your things from your creditor who took possession after foreclosure. In case the bank refuses or does not inform the where abouts of your goods then you may claim compensation. Ownership in property belongs to you and therefore you may claim rights to your goods. Along with the eviction notice a lawsuit may have been filed and lack of service of documents to you seriously affects your rights. In this, you may challenge the order of court. However, you will have to pay storage charges for your goods. Wisconsin Statutes 799.45 deals with the subject.<br/>

								When my father in law passed away we (my wife and I) were partners in owning a home with him and my mother in law.  To make matters clear for in the future we bought out my Mother in laws share and gave her a life estate.  several years later I was in construction and fell on a job and injured my back, being self employed I am not covered under workers comp. and my own health insurance does not cover much more than emergency service.<br/>
<br/>
As the course continued My wife and I were forced to file bankruptcy and the bank is following through on forclosure.  My wife and I understand this and are now starting to rebuild our lifes and want to move on.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is we now have the banks lawyer going after my mother in law because she is listed as an owner.  We did a quick claim deed and she gave up her ownership but the lawyer is still seeking a judgement against her and will only stop this if we agree to signing documents that favor the bank completely and would cost us thousands of dollars.  <br/>
<br/>
The real question is how do you fight off a lawyer when you don't have the money to hire another lawyer to do it?<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way for the judge to know that the judgenment the lawyer is seeking is for something that is no longer there?

								Re: Life estate problems: How do you fight off a lawyer?<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that a person may either represent himself or herself or may be represented by a lawyer. In this regard, as the bank has started legal proceedings against your mother in law therefore your mother in law can represent herself in court. Further, the charges of the bank may be contested by your mother in law. She may inform court of the correct position and can challenge the claims of the bank. If your mother in law is unable to hire an attorney nor be in a position to represent herself then she may seek guidance from Legal Aid in the matter.<br/>

								Hello<br/>
I currently live in my elderly Dads home and take care of both him and my brother who has short term memory loss and epilepsy.  I am trying to save enough money for a down payment on my Dads house so I can keep my brother there after my dad passes away.  He has been there almost all of his life and it would be hard to move him.  I only have a portion of the down payment saved.  I am on the will but not on the deed or mortgage loan.  If everything is left to me, does the deed automatically transfer to my name or will the bank (Wells Fargo) take the house? Is there a way to transfer the mortgage to myself without having to put down 20%?  If anyone can offer any suggestions on what I can do, I would really appreciate it. <br/>
Thank you

								My mom died in February 2010.<br/>
<br/>
Her only asset was a condo valued at $350K and a mortgage with a payoff of $500K (monthly payments of $2,400/month).  The estate had no cash; mom's social security and a retirement plan covered her expenses but there was no savings and they stopped paying when she passed away.<br/>
<br/>
My sister/the-executor-of-mom's-estate and I cannot afford the mortgage payment to keep the condo and selling it wouldn't bring in enough to pay off the mortgage.<br/>
<br/>
So, in April, my sister rented it out to a tenant (after informing that person that the property would go into foreclosure).  The rent is $1,600 per month and my sister wants to start sending me $800 per month.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what she is doing is legal and am afraid that if I accept half of the rent, that I'm going to get in some sort of trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I'm aware of...<br/>
<br/>
California Civil Code 890. (a) (1) ""Rent skimming"" means using revenue received from the<br/>
rental of a parcel of residential real property at any time during<br/>
the first year period after acquiring that property without first<br/>
applying the revenue or an equivalent amount to the payments due on<br/>
all mortgages and deeds of trust encumbering that property.<br/>
<br/>
If she hasn't transferred the property out of our mom's name (mom owned it for over 10 years) and it was rented to the tenant by ""The Estate of Jane Doe,"" does the clock reset to year one, or are we still in year 10?<br/>

I wish to inform you that executor can perform only those functions which are provided in will. In this regard, if the executor intends to give house on mortgage then he can do so if provided by will.

<br/>
Thanks, not sure if I understood the response.<br/>
<br/>
The executor has decided to let the bank foreclose on the property because there is no money to pay the mortgage.<br/>
<br/>
The executor rented out the unit and informed the tenant that the bank would eventually foreclose.<br/>
<br/>
The executor, who is one of two heirs, doesn't plan to give any of the rent money to the bank.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, the executor, wants to keep half the rent for herself and give me, the other heir, the other half of the rent.<br/>
<br/>
I'm am hesitant to accept half of the rent money because I think that the action of the executor might meet the definition of ""rent skimming,"" and if I accept the money, I'd be guilty of rent skimming and also possibly conspiracy.<br/>
<br/>
That opinion hinges on the definition of ""acquiring"" in the law.  If a person dies, does their estate ""acquire"" the property, in a legal sense?  Or is the estate's stewardship of the property an extension of the dead person's ownership?  In other words, is this still year 10 of Mom's ownership until the estate goes through probate or did the ownership clock reset to zero when she died?

								Re: renting out a property without paying mortgage<br/>
<br/>
I may be wrong, but I believe rent skimming involves intentionally purchasing a property with a mortgage for the sole purpose of renting it out &amp; not paying the mortgage, just to collect rent from the day the property is purchased until the day the bank completes foreclosure. I may be wrong, I am not a lawyer.

								I have completed everything needed to be considered for a consolidated loan from a bank to pay off high interest loans.  Because of so many delays, some of my documents have expired.  The bank recently asked me to sign and submit a new 4506 T form for 2008 and 2009  tax returns for 1040, 1099 and W2's because the old 4506T expired.  I have already submitted copies of my 2007 and 2008 tax returns, but just recently filed my 2009 tax return last week because this past year I was overwhelmed with business with serving as executor of my Dad's estate and as conservator for my sister.  (I had filed for an extension earlier).  3 months ago, I provided the bank with a signed copy of a 2009 yearly profit to loss statement from my self-employed business.   When I met with my accountant in preparing the 2009 tax returns, we discovered some categories accidentally omitted on my 2009 yearly profit to loss statement.   <br/>
<br/>
If I submit the 4506T form, the bank will pull the transcripts of my 2009 tax return.  They will see there is a difference in the profit (no losses) of my company.   Should I tell the underwriter (bank) that the 2009 yearly profit to loss statement has been revised and send them a revised sign copy?   Or should I just not submit the 4506T form and lose the chance of getting the loan?   If I submit the 4506T form and they see there is a difference in the profit of the company (not as much as originally stated on the unrevised 2009 yearly statement), they won't approve the loan and might accuse me of fraud.  I want to be honest and upfront with the bank.  I have not intentionally mislead anyone.  But due to some sloppy bookkeeping, I was not accurate with the 2009 statement.<br/>
<br/>
Please advise as to what I should do at this point.  I will not submit anything until advised further.

You can sue her in small claims for amounts due,<br/>

								Re: sister and jointly owned property<br/>
<br/>
You can sue her in small claims for amounts due,<br/>
and/or if  two or more owners cannot agree on what to do with a piece of property they may petition the court and the court will order a sale or refinancing etc. so that the one or more may get out of the property obligation and/or the other(s) may keep it etc.--it is often done--  (This is true in some cases even for equitable owners that have paid various amounts etc., but for various reasons, may not be on title.) You could threaten to take this action if need be. It may cause compromise.

								Please Help.  We have a rental home in Michigan that is only Days away from the end of our 6 month redemption period.  My Step-Mom was to purchase the home in Her name only!  Sole owner.  She did this to help with my plans to renovate a Michigan home.  We did so and is now rented to bad renters who Slow paid/Never paid the rent.  It is due to be taken over by the Bank Sept. 11, (1 week)  My father never intended to be on this loan but did lend me the down-payment (which I've paid back) On the day of Closing he gave my Step-Mom the down-payment check and went on his usual routine...Lunch--errands--gym.  They live in Florida and Dad is now 80 yrs old.  He was called frantically to rush to the Closing Office because he was told the Loan couldn't close unless he signed a paper saying he was aware of my Step-mom taking out this loan.  He signed the papers.  He never once thought he was on the Mortgage until I went to the Records/Deed office at the courthouse and his name was Badly Applied to all forms!  Even the Records Lady helping me said it was Obviously falsified...she'd never seen so many Cross-outs..misspelled his name, No address for him, his is different than my Step-mom. They only have copies of non-signed MTG papers..He know thinks he has No recourse since he says its his signature but he's Hopping Mad.  This was a predatory loan, Put together by American Wholesale Lenders, Ohio, Countrywide, now BAC and MERS is bringing the foreclosure.  Everything about this loan and the dates Jan 2006 are all Bad news all over the internet!....How can we OR Can we stop/stay this takeover immediately?...Should my father file charges in Fl?...And what kind of charges? and how can we keep the house since the renters are squatting/no rent and trying to buy the home the minute the 11th gets here!!...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading, Any Advice is very appreciated!

								Is this true below? I I walk away from the mortgage is that the extent of it. This little article makes me wanna say forget it.<br/>
<br/>
_____<br/>
<br/>
More and more commercial real-estate companies are doing what many indebted homeowners would like to do: Walk away from mortgages on properties that are now worth a lot less than they paid for them.<br/>
<br/>
Today's Wall Street Journal highlights three major developers - Macerich, Vornado Realty Trust and Simon Property Group - that have recently decided to default on mortgages.<br/>
<br/>
When companies do this, no one bats an eye--it's just ""smart business.""<br/>
<br/>
When ordinary homeowners think about doing it, meanwhile, the mortgage industry and government begin moaning that a mortgage is more than a business contract. It's a social contract, in which homeowners have a ""moral obligation"" to pay.<br/>
<br/>
That's bunk. An individual mortgage is no different than a corporate mortgage. If corporations are allowed to walk away from mortgage obligations without feeling shame and guilt, then individuals should be able to do so, too.<br/>
<br/>
The contract homeowners sign when they take out a mortgage spells out exactly what happens if the homeowner stops making payments on the loan.  The lender has the right to foreclose on the house, taking the homeowner's downpayment with it.  In addition, the borrower's credit rating will usually get destroyed, and, in some states, the lender can come after his or her other assets to recoup the capital the lender has lost.<br/>
<br/>
Those are big penalties.  They provide a major incentive for the borrower to continue making his or payments.  And that's why the lender, a corporation, put them in the contract.<br/>
<br/>
Importantly, the lender voluntarily entered into the contract--and it did so because it thought doing so was a smart business decision. That it actually turned out to be a lousy business decision is not the homeowner's fault. It's the lender's fault. And the borrower, who is already feeling plenty of pain his or herself, should not have to bear the burden of guilt and shame on top of everything else.

								I am an investor. I was not aware I needed a business license in order to rent out property.  I want to know should the lenders be responsible for informing investors about needing a license?  Where should I have gone or what should have triggered me to research this before I purchased the property? I know a lot of investors and none of them have licenses and none have heard they need a license. Some people don't even believe me when I tell them.  A tenant was mad because I wanted him to move and he called the Building and Safety and they cited me for no license.  Everything else was okay with the property.  The tenant snatched down the smoke detector and tried to say there was no smoke detector but all the paint came off with it and you could see the circle where the detector was.  The inspector recognized what the tenant was doing but now I have to get a license for property I have never made one cent on.  The note has always been more than the rent and I have always had to put money with the property plus do evictions and repairs.  There is a law that says if you have a business and it has been a loss for five years then it is considered a hobby.  I definitely would fall under the hobby with my properties. I have read quite a few landlord books and have never seen anything about a business license.  Is this kept secret so they can pick and choose who to enforce?

It is usually not such a big deal if you do have to get a license. And the penalties should be minor.<br/>

In many jurisdictions no license is needed if that is not your main business. Check the many exemptions.

								Hello,<br/>
We recently received a notification from an Attorney's office that the house we are renting is going to be foreclosed soon and we might be asked to leave anytime. Surprised, we called our landlords (owners of the house) who told us they were as surprised as us. Apparently, they decided to move out of state and lease their house while their refinancing application (from FHA to conventional I think) was being processed. Apparently, this is illegal and is the same thing as ""defaulting"" , even though they 've been making the payments regularly. They are battling to recuperate their house, and it is not looking too good. <br/>
We are thinking one good option for us (not being kicked out would be a very good one <img alt="""" border=""0"" class=""inlineimg"" smilieid=""1"" src=""https://forum.legaljunkies.com/core/images/smilies/smile.png"" title=""Smile""/> ) would be to offer the home owners to sell us the house on a short sale before it forecloses and their credit takes a hit.<br/>
Any advice/input on this case? I know the bank that ""owns"" the house is the one that ultimately makes the decision if a short sale is possible, but they won't give us any info.<br/>
Thanks for any help on the subject.

								re: Leasing while Refinancing (short sale of the house)<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that you may first discuss with the house owner regarding short sale. In this regard if house owner agrees then you may discuss with the bank about short sale. Short sale is a method which may be used to avoid foreclosure. In this, you may argue with the bank that instead of adopting costly foreclosure procedure bank may agree to short sale. <br/>

								Michigan. In 2003 my father passed away followed by my mother in 2004. I bought my parents house from my siblings for $1, with the exception of my son who my parents adopted. My name, my husband's name and my minor son's name is all on the deed. The loan how ever was in my parent's names. I'm aware of the Garn - St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, and I assumed payments on the loan. At that time Washington Mutual was the lender and I was able to rework the loan that was in default and bring it current. A couple years later Wells Fargo bought the loan when Washington Mutual went under. In the 4 1/2 years since we took over payments on the loan, we managed to get 5 years ahead on the loan when my husband got laid off of work. When I knew I was going to miss a payment I called the mortgage company to see if I could work something out with them. They refused to talk me about anything in regards to the loan because my name wasn't on the mortgage. <br/>
<br/>
They did how ever say that they would talk to my sister who was the executor of the estate, which was closed in 2007 and was released from her duties then. The mortgage company, Wells Fargo, acted like they were going to work with us. But they only gave me the run around requesting information that they already had on file, asking me to send different verifications and proof. And after they would have something, they would tell me it was the wrong information and I need to send more. This went on for some time. After sending the latest information they had requested, I called to make sure they got it on file and to ask what I needed to do next. To my surprise I learned that they had foreclosed on my house a couple days after they requested more information. I got no notice of the foreclosure at all. <br/>
<br/>
If there is a law in effect saying I can take over payments on a loan if it's an inheritance, aren't they then obligated by law to talk with me about this loan? All they had to do was talk with me and rework the loan so it was current. My payment would have even been less because we were so far ahead on it. Bank of America has since bought the house and I would have to redeem it from them for more then what was owed on the loan. They know I can't redeem the loan because banks won't lend for mortgages under 40k, in addition to not having any credit. They bought the property in hopes that they would make money on it, being valued at twice what I owed. <br/>
<br/>
Isn't there anything I can do about this or get compensation for my house? It looks like I'm not the only one Wells Fargo has jerked around.

								Re: Laws protecting inherited property?<br/>
<br/>
I want to inform you that it was you who had worked out the loan with Washington Mutual and the loan was then transferred to Wells Fargo. Further, you have been in touch with Wells Fargo till their sudden decision to foreclose the loan and sell the property to Bank of America. In Michigan the new laws PA 29, PA 30 and PA 31 have been incorporated in 2009 for a period of two years. Under these laws, Wells Fargo was to discuss loan modification or loan default and remedial measures with you prior to going in for foreclosure. You may issue a written notice to both Wells Fargo and Bank of America. You can inform them of the facts. If they fail to reconcile the matter with you then you may file a lawsuit. The court will consider all the facts and decide the matter.<br/>

								Re: Laws protecting inherited property?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for that information. It was useful. I was reading and saw that VA, Fanny Mae type loans aren't included in those laws. I'm trying to research that, as this was VA loan that my father obtained. <br/>
<br/>
What I'm confused about or trying to find out is, was not the mortgage lender legally obligated to talk with me as the inheritor of this house and loan even though my name was not on the loan itself? They sure had no problem with taking my money for 4 1/2 years. <br/>
<br/>
The Garn-St. Germain Depository Act of 1982 recognises inheritors of properties with loans and the unfair act of  ""due on sale"" clauses. According to that law, all I needed to do was provide a death certificate and inform the lender that I was taking over payments. Which I did years before this issue even arose. I provided death certificates to Washington Mutual when they had the loan and then to Wells Fargo when they took over the loan because they couldn't find it on record. <br/>
<br/>
It just seems kind of funny to me, that Wells Fargo wouldn't talk to me (and I did provide them with the deed in my name) even though they have no one else to talk to. My eldest sister was named conservator of the estate. We had a lawyer. Her duties were over when the estate was closed in 2007, (we provided papers on that also) but Wells Fargo had no problem talking with her about my house and loan. I don't think that was legal either. <br/>
<br/>
This whole mess would have never happened if the mortgage company would have talked to me because I called them the month after I was late with my payment. It could have been avoided. But I'm not going to pay for something that will inevitably be taken away because they refused to talk to me.

After sending the latest information they had requested, I called to make sure they got it on file and to ask what I needed to do next. To my surprise I learned that they had foreclosed on my house a couple days after they requested more information. I got no notice of the foreclosure at all. <br/>
<br/>
If there is a law in effect saying I can take over payments on a loan if it's an inheritance, aren't they then obligated by law to talk with me about this loan? All they had to do was talk with me and rework the loan so it was current. My payment would have even been less because we were so far ahead on it. Bank of America has since bought the house and I would have to redeem it from them for more then what was owed on the loan. They know I can't redeem the loan because banks won't lend for mortgages under 40k, in addition to not having any credit. They bought the property in hopes that they would make money on it, being valued at twice what I owed. <br/>
<br/>
Isn't there anything I can do about this or get compensation for my house? It looks like I'm not the only one Wells Fargo has jerked around.

								Re: Laws protecting inherited property?<br/>
<br/>
I want to inform you that it was you who had worked out the loan with Washington Mutual and the loan was then transferred to Wells Fargo. Further, you have been in touch with Wells Fargo till their sudden decision to foreclose the loan and sell the property to Bank of America. In Michigan the new laws PA 29, PA 30 and PA 31 have been incorporated in 2009 for a period of two years. Under these laws, Wells Fargo was to discuss loan modification or loan default and remedial measures with you prior to going in for foreclosure. You may issue a written notice to both Wells Fargo and Bank of America. You can inform them of the facts. If they fail to reconcile the matter with you then you may file a lawsuit. The court will consider all the facts and decide the matter.<br/>

								Re: Laws protecting inherited property?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for that information. It was useful. I was reading and saw that VA, Fanny Mae type loans aren't included in those laws. I'm trying to research that, as this was VA loan that my father obtained. <br/>
<br/>
What I'm confused about or trying to find out is, was not the mortgage lender legally obligated to talk with me as the inheritor of this house and loan even though my name was not on the loan itself? They sure had no problem with taking my money for 4 1/2 years. <br/>
<br/>
The Garn-St. Germain Depository Act of 1982 recognises inheritors of properties with loans and the unfair act of  ""due on sale"" clauses. According to that law, all I needed to do was provide a death certificate and inform the lender that I was taking over payments. Which I did years before this issue even arose. I provided death certificates to Washington Mutual when they had the loan and then to Wells Fargo when they took over the loan because they couldn't find it on record. <br/>
<br/>
It just seems kind of funny to me, that Wells Fargo wouldn't talk to me (and I did provide them with the deed in my name) even though they have no one else to talk to. My eldest sister was named conservator of the estate. We had a lawyer. Her duties were over when the estate was closed in 2007, (we provided papers on that also) but Wells Fargo had no problem talking with her about my house and loan. I don't think that was legal either. <br/>
<br/>
This whole mess would have never happened if the mortgage company would have talked to me because I called them the month after I was late with my payment. It could have been avoided. But I'm not going to pay for something that will inevitably be taken away because they refused to talk to me.

								Hi there. I'm not sure if I post in the right forum. I'm sorry if I'm wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My story is kinda complicated and silly...<br/>
<br/>
I was applying a mortgage refinance a while ago. The agent (from Citi bank) gave me an ""OK"" rate, and wanted me to signed couple forms (Good Faith Estimate and other forms). I sent him an email and saying that I have reviewed the documents he sent to me and wanted him to answer me a list of questions before I actually could send the signed forms. I didn't get the answer that time (he later claimed he did reply me with answers. I found the emails in the work email spam folder much much later). I was busy that time since I didn't get any info so I forgot about it. I also went out of town for a week or so and left my cell in the office. During the time when I was gone, he only sent one email to my personal email saying he was looking for me and I replied back that I was out of town and left my cell in office. And he did not send anything back since then. 10 days later when I'm back, I got a lot of voice mails from him. And the last one saying the broker is gonna charge me 600 dollars for 'canceling'. <br/>
<br/>
I was totally surprised. <br/>
<br/>
Could anyone give me an idea what I should do next? I'm afraid that they are going to hand this to collection agency and ruin my credit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Henry

Live foreclosure auctions online.<br/>
<br/>
I saw this site one day on a news headline on my email. I clicked the link and I read everything and was interested. I read all the documents that were displayed per auction and I felt that it was legitimate and that was the price of the property and thats it. I bid and won a property on the site. I guess I was out of my mind that I would win a property for $6000. Ends up being that I bid and won the lien that was owed to the Association. It was the Association against the Owners.There is a mortgage lien on it as well, that I was unaware of. I actually received the document of what I purchased and it says Title of Property. What can I do with this? What would you recommend?

								Re: Foreclosure online auction: I bid and won a property on the site<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that a valid contract has resulted when your bid was accepted and the property was allotted to you in auction. The user agreement of the website governs your right to terminate the contract. In that case, if you intend to terminate the contract then your amount deposited may be forfeited under user agreement. However, you may contest the contract on the ground that correct details pertaining to the property were not informed to you and as the contract of sale is based upon misleading information therefore contract is voidable. In this regard, you will have to show that you had relied upon seller's information and  they had specified Home Owners Association debt but had not written about any other mortgage debt. This has given impression that there is only Home Owners Association lien on the property and hence your contract is voidable because of your not being provided complete information by seller. You can serve a written notice and if the matter is not resolved file a lawsuit.<br/>

								Last year I agreed to help out family member with morgage that was about to be taken away by their bank. I agreed to act as a buyer only (join with another co-signer) so the morgage can be saved and they can still live there. Of course, there were some financial incentives for doing this, which we both agreed upon verbally prior to signing the dotted line. But to date, I have nothing in return other than a bad credit due to their late payments and they have done taxes on it (which includes the 1st time buyer credit) without my knowing it!!! I was told that I cannot do anything about this to remove my name out of the morgage until they refinance the morage. Is this true and is there anything I can do to remove myself from this nightmare!???? <br/>

I wish to inform you that when you act as purchaser then you have become liable to the mortgage amount. In this, you may be liable for the amount of loan if an agreement was made between you and mortgage company. Further, when you had agreed to act as buyer then you knew about the mortgage and there was consideration as you were promised some financial gains. However if the agreement was between you and your relative and no specific agreement between you and mortgagee has been there then you may not be liable for mortgage because of privity of contract as a stranger to contract cannot file a suit. <br/>

								I bid on a foreclosure that was for sale. We were outbid by 575 dollars on approximatley 250k home. We found out that the only other bidder we were bidding against was another realtor in the same office where we submit our bid. We beleive the other bidder/realtor got to look at our bid to allow him or his clients to beat our bid by merely 575 dollars. They review the bids before submitting them to the seller, which is a bank in this case. Also note this is a very small agency with only 2 realtors, those being the listing agent of the property and the eventual winning realtor that was bidding against us. Both realtors in this agency work on the REO's Also note this agency has many REO's for sale. This particular home had a very substantial price drop that exceeded by double or more any price drops on the other REO's the agency lists. And right after the price drop the bidder we lost to, put in a much lower bid to get the property at even a lower price. We also believe that either the winning realtor or a relative of the realtor is the actual buyer\new owner of the property. We suspect foul play and conflict of interest. We also believe the seller, which is the bank, was defrauded in this case.  The reason for the fraud is because of the substantial price decrease. What do you think.  Thank you.

								Re: resent time share purchase: want to end our contract<br/>
<br/>
I would like to inform you that your agreement terms govern your right to termination. In this regard, generally there is a right to resell the time share bought by you. Alternatively, you may give a termination notice and in this you may be liable to pay for breach of contract as prescribed in the contract and terminate it. If the sale of time share to you was made on grounds which were fraudulent or inaccurate then you may give a written notice to the company. If the time share company does not resolve the matter then you may file a lawsuit. You can bring to the notice of the court that the agreement was not signed by free will and state the inaccurate information provided to you. The court will decide the matter after considering all the facts. Alternatively, you may report the matter to the Federal Trade Commission.<br/>

								To whom it may concern:<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kelly and I was approved for a loan modification and sent a packet the end of 2009. The first payment of this modification was due Feb. 1, 2010. I signed the agreement and have never missed a payment since I was first approved for the mortgage back in 2007. <br/>
<br/>
I received a new packet in the mail last Fri.  from the same company that approved the modification. The packet included most of the original info (backdated Dec 2009) with an increase of $77 to my monthly payment. A letter stated the company did a quality audit and found they made a mistake on my loan and I have 10 days to re-sign the packet and send back reflecting the new amount. Also included are trial-period coupons that I am supposed to include with my adjusted payment (dated Feb. 1 2010). How can this be a trial period when I already went through one 4 months before the modification was finalized and with my next payment due June 1st 2010?<br/>
<br/>
Can the mortgage company change the modification amount after an agreement was made and signed over 4 months ago?   <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your help.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Kelly

You can object and argue you relied on the signed deal. <br/>
<br/>
They may compromise with you.<br/>
<br/>
You could prevail if you went to court and sought compensation for that.

<br/>
First of all, thank you for your response!<br/>
<br/>
I talked to the company yesterday and tried to attest. They told me I have to pay the new amount if I want to remain current in the modification program. They are supposed to send me another packet with the correct dates sometime.<br/>
<br/>
Something else that was included in the packet was an error and omissions/compliance agreement form that I am to sign. This form was never included in the first packet. Are they trying to have me sign so they can cover themselves?    <br/>
<br/>
I am so confused!  I am unemployed and with this increase, makes it even more difficult to pay.  <br/>
Even if I felt I could afford it, who is to say this will not happen again in the future. <br/>
<br/>
I don’t  know what to do. I want to go to a lawyer but I cannot afford one. I want to continue paying the first mod. amount but I do not want them to mess up my credit or create more problems. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!

								To whom it may concern:<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kelly and I was approved for a loan modification and sent a packet the end of 2009. The first payment of this modification was due Feb. 1, 2010. I signed the agreement and have never missed a payment since I was first approved for the mortgage back in 2007. <br/>
<br/>
I received a new packet in the mail last Fri.  from the same company that approved the modification. The packet included most of the original info (backdated Dec 2009) with an increase of $77 to my monthly payment. A letter stated the company did a quality audit and found they made a mistake on my loan and I have 10 days to re-sign the packet and send back reflecting the new amount.

								Hello..we are having an issue with Wells Fargo Mortgage..we have lived in our current home for 4 years most of which our loan was thru Wachovia, our loan is now with wells fargo (not of my choosing)..a few months ago after inquiring as to if we could redo the loan to a more manageable payment...i was transferred to a loss mitigation department employee who took an application from me over the phone to see if we qualified for any loan modification...I got a call from a very personable employee in Minneapolis, MN who made us an offer..keep in mind that at no time were we ever late on any payments...that being said the offer was that of a moritorium..I had her explain what that would mean..she said that the loan would be on a hold for 6 mos..after 6 months a balloon payment would be due of just a little over 6,400. keep in mind our payment is normally over 2,100 a month..I questioned her on two different occassions at great length asking her why they would be willing to do this!<br/>
..she said..""well to give you time to pay off some bills and get caught up""..it seemed like a good offer, eventho it wasn't what we originally wanted which was a lower payment..after the 6 months we were supposed to be able to pick up where our payments left off...we have a signed document agreeing to this amount which they offered to us..our file has been transferred to a new worker at Wells Fargo who informed me yesterday that the moritorium was figured incorrectly and that we owe over $12,000 and that it is simple math..I asked her if it was simple math, why did they make the mistake &amp; why would we have ever agreed to such a thing..after all we were making our payments..Yesterday they gave us an option of redoing the loan at the same interest rate of 5.75 with a higher payment...if feels like they are forcing us into a bad loan...can they do this to us with a signed agreement with the $6,400 figure?

<br/>
Based on what you say here, you could file suit against them (or at least threaten to do so) in small claims court or in regular court; filing in small claims court is easier and requires no attorney...you could try to collect all of the costs and damages that you suffered due to their behavior... You may also report them to your state attorney general's office and Dept of Banking. Also inform your Congress person. <br/>
<br/>
Attorneys could also become directly involved if need be.

								How can a mortgage lender give me an 80/20 loan for the purchase of a home and make me pay PMI insurance? I have foreclosed on the property and the 2nd mortgage is at a collection agency that has a bank garnishment and took everyting I have. I thought that since the 80/20 loan was for a primary residence and the same lender gave both loans I would be covered under the non-recourse laws in North Dakota? And since the house was not foreclosed yet shouldn't they have tried to foreclose instead of sending to collections since the loan was backed by the house? I tried to talk to the company but they kept telling me that the bank makes the decisions. I got the run around and eventully just gave up after they sent the money I was to send them back and said there was nothing they could do anymore. I didn't send them any money after that and called back 6 months later to see if Obamas plan could help and they told me that North Dakota was not doing that plan and they wouldn't be able to help because I haven't made any payments for awhile they didn't care that I told them I tried you sent it back saying there was nothing that you could do anymore. Please help I am lost with all this.

								My husband and I purchased a property.  He passed away and I tried to make it and did for about 1 1/2 years of struggling to save it, but of course it wasn't worth what we paid and housing market was bust.  It was owner financed.  He sweet talked me and said he would work with me due to the circumstances, if I would sign a Grant Deed back to him.  I did and the minute I signed it and it was notarized and I handed it to him for him to record, his attitude changed completely.  He ordered me out of the property within 7 days, and said if it was over that it would be $50.00 per day rent.<br/>
I got out, and now I just found out a little over a year later that he never filed it with the county recorder, although he rented it out to a family the same month I vacated, and is collecting rent on the property that is still in my name.  He is leaving me liable for all the taxes, water bills, liability on the property if anything happens or anyone gets hurt.<br/>
He is a licensed real estate agent, and owned the property although he has placed the property we purchased in a family trust with him selling it etc.<br/>
Now being a widow, I can't qualify for any programs to help me such as food stamps etc being on a fixed income.  I know this can't be legal.  Can he be sued or what should I do to resolve this.

								Re: Do you still have to pay rent when property is in forclosure?<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you will be liable to pay rent till the time you are having possession of the premises because the lease is still subsisting. If lease gets terminated then you may not be liable but before that you are. In this generally you will pay rent to your existing landlord till the time you do not get notice of change in ownership. The Rule is that when you are using the premises you may be liable for rent and by foreclosure mainly the owner may change but possession is with you and you are using the premises.<br/>

								Bank of America has accepted our short sale offer (first and second), but they want me to sign a promissory note for $30,000.<br/>
The first is about $235,000 and the second is about $15,000.<br/>
The short sale offer is for $145,000.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot afford to pay the Promissory note of $30,000.<br/>
<br/>
Would I be better off letting it go to foreclosure (state of Nevada) and filing bankruptcy to avoid being sued for the deficiency amount?<br/>
<br/>
Or, should I sign the promissory note and then file bankruptcy on that smaller amount? Is that an option? Can I file for bankruptcy after I sign the promissory note?<br/>

Promissory note + bankruptcy X Foreclosure + bankruptcy? <br/>

								re: Foreclosure X Short Sale? (Bank of America)<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that when you go for bankruptcy, all your creditors will be taken into account and your assets may be sold to pay the amount due to the creditors. In this, if you sign a promissory not and then go in for bankruptcy then your liabilities will increase and if you do short sale then your assets will be reduced for your creditors. Therefore, you can file for bankruptcy keeping in view that after bankruptcy the creditor cannot come after you and therefore maximum amount of liability you should have at the time of filing bankruptcy so that you are able to reduce your liability.<br/>

								My husband died last April (no insurance) and I have been getting conflicting requirements from first CountryWide and now BAC Home Loans.  I was denied a forebearance so I put my house up for sale then 5 months later get a phone call telling me I don't qualify for a forebearance cuz I listed my house.  I call again asking for help and lo and behold I have a Freddie Mac Loan!  Something that was not told to me or my HUD rep. So, I fill out the forms, gather the docs and write my hardship letter.  In November BAC sends a packet and I fill out the forms, gather the docs, and write another Hardship letter.  I take the house off the market, make the requested payments and in March I get the offer which was very generous but unsustainable for someone now on SSA.  So, I ask to do a Deed in Lieu only to be told I don't qualify because my house has not been on the market in the last 60 days.<br/>
  Now the house is back on the market as a Short Sale but my stress tolerance is very thin.  Can I move out if I maintain the property and utilities? Or would it be considered abandonment?

<br/>
I wish to inform you that even if you move out then also house will be under your possession till the time lock and keys of the house are with you. In this the house will be with you till the time you have your lock on the home and will not be considered abandoned. I further wish to inform you that you are not personally liable for the debts of your husband unless you have accepted your personal liability. Creditors of your husband can take their money from the assets of the deceased but not making you personally liable or from your assets.<br/>

								I brought a property in 2003 using a bank loan from Citibank and then moved the balance transfer to ABN Amro. During these transactions I did’t have any issues then now when I’m trying to move the BT to another bank am running into few issues as below.<br/>
The bank asked for the EC’s right from 1986 when the actual property was allocated to the previous owner. Now that when I’m checking the EC I find the previous owner had mortgaged the property sometime in 1989, he had also taken about 13.5 lacs of loan of which I’m able to track repayment for only 7.5 lacs. Then not able to track for the remaining amount. What are the legal implications for all this keeping in mind these questions.<br/>
1)	The property was brought in 2003 : its been close to 7 yrs now.<br/>
2)	I find the property was mortgaged in 1989, the last payment was in 2003 (as per EC), this bank has hence gone bust and was taken over by another bank in Feb 26, 2007<br/>
3)	I have all the original documents : All deposited with ABN AMRO (the bank with which I have my current bank loan)<br/>
4)	No bank has approached me so far for any dues<br/>
5)	EC has entries marked as DTD for about 5.5 lacs that do not have any receipt (Payment).<br/>
6)	The latest EC, I took from BDA (Bangalore Development authority) as of 1st march 2010 , has the last entry  marked as sale transferring the property to my name(2003).<br/>
<br/>
Questions<br/>
1)	Now that it’s been close to 7 yrs will the bank get back to me to make the payment? I understand it’s hard to make comments here, would help with few suggestions, will help if you can explain in plain English like the usual bank procedure.<br/>
2)	Since the loan was taken by the previous owner, the chances are if there was a case registered it would be against the previous owner, then would not I have heard about this in last 7 years. I understand it’s tough to answer this too, but would help if you can give few suggestions. <br/>
3)	Since I have not been notified so far can I use the 3 yrs timeframe window to bail myself. This is again assuming that the bank has not filed any case against the previous owner.<br/>
4)	Since the entries in EC say DTD, should not the lending bank be having the original documents and its apparent that they don’t and I have, can I use this clause to fight the case if at all they come back on this issue?<br/>
5)	Would it be wise to go back to the bank and inquire if there are any balance to be paid?.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for answering the questions.

								Re: Mortgage shows on Encumbrance certificate: India<br/>
<br/>
If and when the bank pulls all its records together you will have to pay if any amounts are due.<br/>
<br/>
And it will be hard to sell this property with all that confusion.<br/>
<br/>
You can sit quietly and  hope for the best  but I would think at some point everybody will have correct records.

								Scenerio:  Married couple, husband owns home purchased before marriage, wife is not on mortgage but is on title.  couple would like to sell home (short sale ), but are unsure what to do first.  They want to buy first based on wifes income alone (she qualifies right now), with an FHA loan.  Then sell first home in a short sale , i dont think they could do this simutaneously...right??  would the first purchase affect their ability to short sale thier current home, even though she is not on the mortgage of the first home.  My suggestion is that they short sale first and then try to purchase using her credit alone, would FHA still qualify her with a short sale on her husbands credit (remember he is not going to be on the  new purchase) .  my fear is that they purchase first and then the current home lender refuses to do a short sale, because he will see the new purchase (will he??) the home will go to foreclosure and the bank will come after them.  Most times in this environment, the bank is agreeing to forgo any further collection after foreclosure, however due to thier recent purchase I am afraid the bank will not be so forgiving.  Will they even know about the purchase??

								Re: Short Sale: how affects spouse<br/>
<br/>
In case the wife buys a new home this will not affect the bank because the loan was taken by husband and not by wife. The bank has no right to go after the assets of the wife because wife is not on the mortgage. Further, as regards buying a new home is concerned it is submitted that the person involved in giving the loan may get influenced by husband's short sale but the main criteria for lending is the wife's credit status and that is good.<br/>

The options that will help you prevent foreclosure are<br/>
<br/>

								Boy are we in a pickle. We purchased a 24 acre tract of land overlooking a golf course with the intent to sell it off in smaller parcels. We have been paying interest only to the bank since we purchased the property about six months ago, never dreaming it would take this long to sell some of it off. As luck would have it, I also lost my job! We have no prospective buyers on the land and while I have secured another job, the interest only payments are eating our lunch! We are needing to relocate to another city because of my new job, but can't  until we get out from under this money pit parcel of land!  We are considering simply letting the land go back to the bank. What is the worst that could happen if we do that? And, does the bank have options to help prevent us from defaulting on this loan? The bank took a 2nd mortage on a seperate tract of land we own as additional collateral on the tract that is beginning to get us into trouble. Would they claim that too? Our credit score is currently +700, so I hate to think about what this could potentially do to the outstanding credit I have worked so hard for.

<br/>
Yes, if we had any prospective buyers. As of now, none. We have posted the land on the internet, in the newspaper classifieds, 1/2 page full color ad in a monthly real estate magazine, pitched the property to our local builders' association, and have contacted adjoining property owners, with no interest. Have considered an auction, but auction company wants us to pay $5,000 in upfront costs and wants to hold an absolute auction where the land would sell regardless of price. We just can't take the chance that it would sell for some ridiculously low price, still leaving us holding a majority of the debt.

The bank could take it, sell and then even try to sue for any loss they may have. But there is not too much else they can do.<br/>
<br/>
Promoting a sale does seem like a good idea--or maybe the bank will also stretch out payments for a period...

I don't know about the  loan default. but if your refinancing your home make sure the home insurance stays up 2 date....if you let it lapse, they might drop you like a hot potatoe.<br/>
and once your without homeowners insurance its tough to get insured by other companies.<br/>
they figure they didn't want you for a reason...just my own experience....good luck.<br/>

								A friend asked me a question about one of their dad's mortgages.<br/>
<br/>
The situation is their 87 yr old father has a mortgage on a property he sold.  The problem at the closing the company made the check out to their dad instead of the to the company who held the mortgage.  His lawyer told him to cash the check and keep paying the mortgage, my friend told him not to do this, but he listen to his lawyer. The property has been torn down and redeveloped into industrial or commercial property.  <br/>
<br/>
I told my friend I did not think the new owner could have developed the property without making sure the property was free and clear.  Their dad cashed the check and never heard a thing from the company.  Now their dad is in financial straits and is one month behind on the mortgage and does not know what to do.  I told them this is a legal mess and I would seek out some help for them.  My friend wants her dad  to stop paying this mortgage if  he  can, they think the mortgage company has been paid off and is double dipping because their dad is old and vulnerable.<br/>
<br/>
What do I tell them, I have never heard of anything like this!

								Laws in California and other states requiring mortgage companies to talk to troubled homeowners before foreclosing on them are toothless, according to a study released Wednesday. <br/>

The National Consumer Law Center, which analyzed programs in 14 states, said they have failed to help homeowners stave off foreclosure because they lack sanctions or accountability for banks. <br/>
<br/>
""There is as yet no data to confirm that foreclosure-mediation programs anywhere have led to a substantial number of affordable and sustainable loan modifications,"" the report said.

<br/>
My question is what should we do ??? Is the only way to protect her home from being taken to turn this over to the police ??? and Im not sure if that will even help ...are we on the hook for this loan no matter what??? or is there a legal recourse we can take ???

								Utah... I entered into a one year Lease Option contract in Sept, 2007 in Utah.  The Seller told me she would extend it but now wants me out.  She is wanting to retain the entire $18,000 down payment and for me to pay Aug rent which I told her to take out of the down payment.  The middle of July she told me to be out by the end of July and I told her that I couldn't be out that fast.  Now that I have looked up my rights, I am finding that it may be illegal for her to retain the entire down payment even though it states in the contract that it may be non-refundable.  I think that I have an equitable interest and the terms of the lease option state many terms that are like a contract for deed.  I have performed all the repairs on the property and have been in for almost 2 years.  The original down was $13,600 and $200 per month for 22 months adds up to a total of $18,000.  I wonder if I should take her to small claims court and at least get back $10,000 that is the max for small claims in UT.  She has not filed any eviction with the court yet. She says that she is moving in to our house in 2 days from now.  I will block her from doing that without court ordered eviction.  I have just found another place to live, but I don't want to give in to someone who is being harassing and let her get away with an illegal act of retaining such a large amount.  Can I even file a fraud case against her stating that she set me up to take so much money away from me?  I need to know what is the best course of action.

								Re: Lease Option - Do I Have Equitable Interest?<br/>

I intended on closing within the 1 year but I have not been able to do qualify because of job and other related financial issues.  I have been improving my credit but I still don't qualify.  The Seller got the police involved and they are telling me that they consider me an owner because of the large amount of down payment that the seller has elected to keep.  I am told that it is illegal for the seller in a lease option to retain more than 3 times the rent amount.  So legally she owes me back $13,800.  I guess I will have to fight this out in court unless there is some other way to transfer title to me or get her to refund most of the deposit back.

								Re: Lease Option - Do I Have Equitable Interest?<br/>
<br/>
In case you ever do another lease/option, your first mistake was agreeing to put up $13K in option money.  That money is non-refundable and the only way you get to put it to work for you is if you exercise the option.  Then it applies to the purchase of the home.  It is not down payment money as you have stated.  It is consideration for the the agreement... ""good faith"" money.  Most option fees in my area are $2K to $5K, depending on the home of course.  You don't own the home.  The legal owner is whomever holds the deed.  Equitable interest is for a judge to decide.  Your lease was for a year.  It is up and the owner wants you out.  Even if you are a holdover tenant, if the owner does not accept a rent payment during the holdover period, you still need to go.  If you do not have a lease or month-to-month agreement in writing, it does not matter what the owner verbally told you.  You need to man up and get out.<br/>
<br/>
The major problem here, however, is this is what you agreed to.  Now you can't exercise the option and you want to weasel your way out of what you gave as your word.  I'm guessing this is probably why your credit is already in bad shape.  Do the right thing.

								I bought a house in May with my boyfriend of two years. Now two months later, he wants to call it quits and wants me to move out.  He wants to refinance the house in his name, but I do not think he would qualify alone because neither of us initally qualified for the home with out the others income. Can he refinance the house without my approval or signing a quit claim deed? <br/>
<br/>
I want the house to be sold, however the house is in a new housing area , so I think selling it would be impossible at this point. I do not want to sign my rights to the house over to him with a quit claim deed.  Is there any way I can force the house to be sold?  Are there any special stipulations that can be tied to the quit claim deed saying he has to give me half of any equity in the house?<br/>
<br/>
I have no clue what to do at this point.  Any help any one can offer would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
Thank you.

If two or more owners cannot agree on what to do with a piece of property they may petition the court and the court will order a sale or refinancing etc. so that the one or more may get out of the property obligation and/or the other(s) may keep it etc.--it is often done--  (This is true in some cases even for equitable owners that have paid various amounts etc., but for various reasons, may not be on title.)

<br/>
Petition for partition.  Do not sign the quit claim or you won't have any rights to it.  Find out about a petition for partition.  I was told about this because I am currently in the same boat with my ex.  He will either have to buy out your share of the home so that he can keep it or it will have to be sold.  The way it was told to me was that if he couldn't pay you what half of the house is worth, the house would be auction off on the court house steps and your outstanding mortgage would be paid first and if there is anything left over it would be split between the two of you and he would be without a home.  Check into talking to a lawyer that offers free legal advice in your area, be sure to talk to someone in the county that your house is in.  Hope this helps and good luck.

								I bought a house in May with my boyfriend of two years. Now two months later, he wants to call it quits and wants me to move out.  He wants to refinance the house in his name, but I do not think he would qualify alone because neither of us initally qualified for the home with out the others income. Can he refinance the house without my approval or signing a quit claim deed? <br/>
<br/>
I want the house to be sold, however the house is in a new housing area , so I think selling it would be impossible at this point. I do not want to sign my rights to the house over to him with a quit claim deed.  Is there any way I can force the house to be sold?  Are there any special stipulations that can be tied to the quit claim deed saying he has to give me half of any equity in the house?<br/>
<br/>
I have no clue what to do at this point.  Any help any one can offer would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
Thank you.

Truthfully, that depends on your jurisdiction, the type of loan, how far in default you are, and numerous other factors.  The only way to know what, if anything, can be done is to speak with a local attorney just as soon as possible.  Go to the WLD main page and contact them.

Many homeowners are not aware that there are usually several defenses that can be asserted on their behalf in every foreclosure action.  These defenses usually have something to do with the conduct of your loan officer, items not properly disclosed and regulatory requirements that the lender has not complied with.    Some of the options available to you are:<br/>
<ul><li>Loan Modification</li>
<li>Stipulated Foreclosure with no deficiency</li>
<li>Short Sale</li>
<li>Deed in lieu of Foreclosure</li>
<li>Filing Bankruptcy</li>

								What are the risks of foreclosing? We have been hearing so many different things from different people.<br/>
<br/>
We bought a house 12/2004 for $340,000 - now worth less than $200,000 and we still owe full $340,000 (we got screwed into ""pick-a-payment"" loans for a year).<br/>
<br/>
We're thinking about just letting the house go - doesn't make sense to keep it because we are basically paying a huge rent and commuting (drive 60 miles one way to get to work). We want to foreclose and move closer to where we work.<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering what will happen... Can lender garnish wages? Are we liable for capital gains if the bank sells for less than what the original mortgage is for?<br/>
<br/>
So many people are foreclosing. Seems like the easy way out. We just want to make sure we don't get screwed in the future. Just had a baby girl, not sure how long we can make payments on home. Don't want to do something that will hugely jeopardize ourselves and put our daughter in danger of any sort.

<br/>
Answer to your questions: <br/>
1. Lender can garnish wages after obtaining a deficiency judgment. <br/>
2. Congress enacted The Mortgage Forgiveness Act in December 20th, 2007. In summary if it is your primary residence, and you fit all the other requirements, you will not be responsible for the difference. <br/>
Foreclosure is your last option. A foreclosure on your credit report severely reduces obtaining future credit. It is always better to be proactive with your lender than to let the ""hand play out"". First try a loan modification and if you are denied I would suggest a short sale. With a loan modification, the lender may reduce your mortgage payments and/or principal so that you can stay in your house. A short sale is your next best option.

								CHANGES to the Truth in Lending Act that took effect last month, requiring lenders to provide certain disclosures about mortgage fees, will undoubtedly help many borrowers make better-informed loan choices. But some in the industry think the new standards could create further delays in an already slow lending process. <br/>
<br/>
The regulations mandate a three-day review period for the loan documents before the loan process can begin in earnest. And if the interest rate changes even marginally before the settlement date, a new set of disclosure documents must be given to borrowers, restarting the review process.<br/>
<br/>
Don Romano, the past president of the New York Association of Mortgage Brokers, said the new regulation would “add a level of consumer protection” to the mortgage process. But, he said, “it takes a lot of flexibility away from the borrower, in getting to the closing table at the best time.”<br/>

								My husband accepted work in Arizona so we moved, leaving the house up for sale in Michigan.  While in Arizona, the mortgage company, Countrywide refused to let us do a short sale during the time the economy went sour.  Our house was no longer considered to be as valuable as our appraisal said it was.  We had a very hard time selling it, for we had a second mortgage done on it while we were trying to get equitty for combining credit cards and the mortgage and doing house repairs.  That company that gave us a second mortgage was Citibank and they refused to release the house for selling till the mortgage company, Countrywide finally agreed to letting us do a short sale on the house.  We were non stop on the phone and doing fax's and mail for months.  We were given wrong numbers, bogus names and no extension numbers that applied to anyone we spoke to.  Our files got lost in the mail or the fax's were gone or needed to be resubmitted or told they never got them.  We were given poor advice such as we didn't qualtify for a short sale until we were late on payments so we tried that and it failed.  Then we had to file a hardship report to be considered for the short sale.  Then we were told we had to go bankrupt to be considered for the short sale. Then we paid back payments and they kept adding interest etc. to put more pressure on us.  Then we had to make some strange payments to a short sales manager to make our house pass the time needed to qualify for the previlage of short sales.  All during which we got those nasty people from the collections offices threatening us and demanding payments.    We only looked bad and felt bad.  Terrible stress!!!!!<br/>
  It all boils down to we finally were able to sell the house and have the second mortgage released to us which we promised to pay.  We eventually were released from that second mortgage which they refused our check for and forgave us the debt.  We appreciated that since we were put through so much for approximately a year or more.  The problem is........ now that we moved back to Michigan because I became ill, we have been notified by banks that our credit has been detailed with the fact that we did a foreclosure on the house, for a short sale is considered a foreclosure by Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) insurance and they refuse to let us have another mortgage.  Preapproval request denied.  Statement of Credit Denial  This is for a conventional mortgage loan application.  Does every one who does a short sale on their homes because of the economy and the change in value of their property get put on a list of foreclosure?  Our neighbors up and left their house and let it go into foreclosure to rent another house.  If we get put on that same list as they were, it would have been cheaper and benefited us just as well, had we done the same as they did by leaving behind the ruins of a house.  Let us know if there is anything we can do about this?  We do have a loan for a new house but we still have that mark on our credit file which we want to remedy if we can.

While in Arizona, the mortgage company, Countrywide refused to let us do a short sale during the time the economy went sour.  Our house was no longer considered to be as valuable as our appraisal said it was.  We had a very hard time selling it, for we had a second mortgage done on it while we were trying to get equitty for combining credit cards and the mortgage and doing house repairs.  That company that gave us a second mortgage was Citibank and they refused to release the house for selling till the mortgage company, Countrywide finally agreed to letting us do a short sale on the house.  We were non stop on the phone and doing fax's and mail for months.  We were given wrong numbers, bogus names and no extension numbers that applied to anyone we spoke to.  Our files got lost in the mail or the fax's were gone or needed to be resubmitted or told they never got them.  We were given poor advice such as we didn't qualtify for a short sale until we were late on payments so we tried that and it failed.  Then we had to file a hardship report to be considered for the short sale.  Then we were told we had to go bankrupt to be considered for the short sale. Then we paid back payments and they kept adding interest etc. to put more pressure on us.  Then we had to make some strange payments to a short sales manager to make our house pass the time needed to qualify for the previlage of short sales.  All during which we got those nasty people from the collections offices threatening us and demanding payments.    We only looked bad and felt bad.  Terrible stress!!!!!<br/>
  It all boils down to we finally were able to sell the house and have the second mortgage released to us which we promised to pay.  We eventually were released from that second mortgage which they refused our check for and forgave us the debt.  We appreciated that since we were put through so much for approximately a year or more.  The problem is........ now that we moved back to Michigan because I became ill, we have been notified by banks that our credit has been detailed with the fact that we did a foreclosure on the house, for a short sale is considered a foreclosure by Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) insurance and they refuse to let us have another mortgage.  Preapproval request denied.  Statement of Credit Denial  This is for a conventional mortgage loan application.  Does every one who does a short sale on their homes because of the economy and the change in value of their property get put on a list of foreclosure?  Our neighbors up and left their house and let it go into foreclosure to rent another house.  If we get put on that same list as they were, it would have been cheaper and benefited us just as well, had we done the same as they did by leaving behind the ruins of a house.  Let us know if there is anything we can do about this?  We do have a loan for a new house but we still have that mark on our credit file which we want to remedy if we can.</div>

Unfortunately it normally does ding your credit but many lenders are willing to work with you these days notwithstanding that record...you may have to look around further.

She had no clue what she was getting into and this deal is taking months and months to go through, she told me she signed alot of papers but the deal wasnt closed.  By the way, she barely speaks a word in english... That bad.<br/>
<br/>
This company is known around here for doing alot of fraudulent loans to alot of illegal immigrants that could never afford to have a home. <br/>

I need to know if she can sue this company for everything they are doing, these people are part of the reason why our economy is going so bad, they should be punished for it.<br/>

								I was married in June 5, 2006 (2nd marriage for both of us).  My husband bought our home that we currently live in.  He closed on in May 18, 2006.  We moved in after we married.  He put the house into a revocable trust June 30, 2006 and is now re-financing the house WITHOUT my name on any of the paperwork.  He says that because it is in a trust, I don't need to be on the loan.  The trust is set up to benefit his family and does not show me receiving anything.  Can the new mortgage company do anything to him if I alert them that he lied on the paperwork...that he is married?  I put down $25,000 towards the house and it seems to me that he is trying to pull the wool over my eyes?!  I would think the mortgage company would try to verify the validity of the info he is giving to them, ecspecially in this economy.  With the mortgage being in a trust that he set up after we married, I would think that the trust would be void since he lied on the paperwork, stating he was ""a single, unmarried male"" on the trust paperwork. I live in OHIO.  Thanks!

								Re: Can husband refinance home without her consent?<br/>
<br/>
Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Call the mortgage company he's doing business with and fax them a copy, or rather, let them know that your name is on the deed. He needs your signature to remove your name from the deed before he can proceed.<br/>
<br/>
If he put the property into his trust and your name was on the deed, it means nothing. You are still a joint tenant and he cannot sell off your interest without your knowledge or consent.<br/>
<br/>
Get yourself to an attorney quickly. This man is committing fraud. And make sure his mortgagers know that your name is still on the deed. Do it quickly before you lose your investment. <br/>
<br/>
And while you're at your attorney's, have him/her draft up divorce papers immediately. This man has, in record time, shown he's incapable of being married. Get out now. It's only going to get worse. <br/>
<br/>
And yes, he is trying to pull the wool over your eyes. Beat him at his own game.

								I am a tenant who lives in a condo that is headed towards foreclosure. My landlord is still collecting rent from me while they are not making payments on the condo. Why should they get to pocket my rent payments when I will just get evicted in the end?<br/>
<br/>
So my question is...what is considered foreclosure status? Can I do anything? A letter arrived stating that the house was in default, and if payments were not made, then the bank would foreclose on the house. Do I still have to continue to pay my landlord rent when they have not paid their mortgage payments over the past year? The letter stated that they had not paid over $18,000 in mortgage payments. <br/>
<br/>
I am in California.<br/>

								Re: Do I still have to pay rent to my LL who is in default?<br/>
<br/>
Simply put you owe rent to whomever is legal owner at time. Until home is actually forclosed on the owner is still your Landlord. You might discuss your leaving with current Landlord to avoid the bank ordering you to leave. If your m2m thats easy give notice and swtart looking for new place. If you have a lease talk to landlord about allowing you to leave before lease expires since he is in foreclosure

<br/>
See your other post.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you start looking for another place to live? Surely if you're aware of an impending foreclosure you don't want to wait until you are forced to leave.<br/>
<br/>
But yes, you are still required to pay rent, regardless of what the landlord does with that money. You cannot control what he does with his money and if he's stupid/irresponsible enough to lose his source of income and his investment, he's not a person you want to be renting from.

The property is ""free and clear"", no liens, mortgages etc. One party on the Deed wants to take a mortgage or line of credit on the house. Probate state. Lawyer states that the house will be re-deeded as diercted by personal representitives. One uncle wants to take mortagage on property.<br/>
<br/>
Questions:<br/>
<br/>
1.If multiple parties are on a Deed, can one party take a mortgage or line of credit out on this property without the consent of the other parties?<br/>
2. Can the personal representitive (brother) make a decision without my wifes involvement? and do we have to live with it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.!!<br/>

								Re: Multiple parties on Deed....who can take mortgage out?<br/>
<br/>
Each party on the deed has equal ownership rights.  I would suggest a petition to the court to auction the property. Converting it to cash... each will get part of the whole.  The uncle will get some cash or the uncle could buy out your part.

The lender usually wants both spouses on the deed (no matter who is on the mortgage) if you refinance. If you are not on the deed you risk arguments about who owns what if you divorce etc., and the lenders don't want any confusion on the issue.

								Re: mortagge is on husband's name and deed is on my name<br/>

that's actually not  necessarily true. we have the same situation.  my name is on the mortgage and his name is on the deed.  we have refinanced twice and the lenders never have cared as long as they get their money.<br/>
<br/>
as far as the divorce thing goes. it will definitely be an argument in court and whoever is NOT on the deed will suffer.

It is relatively unheard of for a bank to finance, or refinance property if the mortgage holder's name is not on the deed. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many lenders do not even want any other name on the deed if they are to purchase or refinance property. It is generally not a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Why anyone would agree to have their name omitted from the deed while being the responsible party as the debtor is a mystery. Only very seedy banks would even touch a situation like that with a 10 foot pole. This would explain why some banks are going belly up right now.

								We were just dismissed from Ch7 and we included our home in the BK.  We received a motion several months ago, to which we responded. We have heard nothing until today, when I received a letter from the BK trustee that is a Notice of Trustees intention to Abandon Property of the estate(Florida Property).  We have heard nothing from the Mortgage Lender, does this mean we need to move out immediately or do we wait to hear from the lender?

								We signed a new loan modification contract last February '09. We have made our 3 months trial period pymts. March, April, May. And we have made the June and July pymts (all early).<br/>
Now the mortgage company is telling me they have negated the contract. They are re-reviewing our status and want to reapply for the Obama plan. Can they negate this contract? I have read the contract and I see nothing regarding this.  the contract can only be voided if we were to default.

								Re: Can our mortgage company negate our contract?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to hear of your circumstances. Generally, absent a default you are indeed correct that this proposed voiding of the contract certainly seems improper.  The best way to know for sure is to have your situation reviewed by a real estate attorney.  I would encourage you to visit the WLD main page.  They have attorneys all over the country and could give you a referral.  Having a lawyer review the documents -- both the original contract and the correspondence from the mortgage company -- is really the only way to go here.  Hope things work out for you in this.

								My ex-husband's wife called me today and said that someone has contacted them and said that he would be able to help my ex refinance his home with a lower interest rate than what he is currently paying (6.65% is what he has now and his payments are over $700/month).  He has had trouble making the payments, but is determined that he wants to keep the house.  He is constantly late but thinks that he would be able to make these lower payments and keep them current.  The only catch is that because I am on the mortgage, I would have to sign the refinance papers with him.  My ex said that if I didn't sign the refinance with him he would have to file for bankruptcy.  I currently live with my husband and children in my father-in-laws home rent free.  I am planning on buying a home in the next year or two.  My current husband has a bankruptcy and home foreclosure on his credit from his divorce in 2004.  What would be the best thing to do in this situation?  Should I let me ex file bankruptcy so that he can could keep this home as his primary residency or should I sign the refinance with him?  What will this do to my credit and how will it reflect on me when I do go to buy my own home?

This is an increasing occurrence. You are legally obligated for all expenses to maintain the property, including HOA fees from the time of your bankruptcy filing.<br/>
<br/>
They can sue you for these items, the HOA could opt to place a lien on the property AND come after you.<br/>
<br/>
There is no legal method to force a lender to foreclose faster. Or at all.<br/>
<br/>
Lenders have been overwhelmed with the problem of foreclosed homes and it is becoming more common that they wait years to foreclose, fully intending that the borrower, not the lender, be stuck with the fees.<br/>

Free rent for those aware of the issue and in the home.

Your obligation will last until the deed is in the lender's name.<br/>

Your obligation will last until the deed is in the lender's name.<br/>

That could be far after the sheriff sale, as well.

Many lenders will work with you and renew the lease but if the mortgage was there before your lease then in many situations you don't have great  rights.<br/>
<br/>
But you normally still need to be evicted if you refuse to leave so they will likely want to negotiate with you.

<br/>
Unfortunately, you don't have too many rights as a tenant. We are currently going through the same thing. In August, we leased a home from a property management group. In December, we were served with foreclosure papers stating the mortgage hadn't been paid since May. In other words, the homeowner allowed us to rent the home when it was already in pre-foreclosure.<br/>
<br/>
Send your landlord a letter via certified, return receipt mail and inform them you are leaving due to impending foreclosure. Unfortunately, you will have to move unless the homeowner is able to obtain a loan modification. Sometimes lenders will provide the homeowner with a loan mod if there are tenants in place. The bank may agree to renew your lease and have you pay them directly.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!

Renters whose states follow the “first in time, first in right” rule, where a lease can be wiped out by a foreclosure if the mortgage was recorded before the lease, will not be able to convince a court to change that rule. But tenants who learn that their new landlord is a bank can at least lessen the financial consequences by suing the former owner.<br/>

Sowhy did they needhim to sign the documents after they got the money? The documents were notarized and predated,with blank spaces for my husband to sign. The documents that were recorded had his name crossed out. So it looks like they tried to get him to sign on for the mortgage. But he refused to and that led to the selling of the house now. But all involved in this mess have gotten away will the scam. I would like this pratice to stop. But no one cares if we don't sue. We don't want to sue anyone. So everyone gets away with this illegal mortgage and illegal home insurance scam. I forgot to mention they got a homeowner's policy to pay less for it instead of a renter's policy. None of the owners live in the house. There are at least 20 lies on the loan. How can they get way with this? There is so much fraud involved!! So many people closed their eyes to let it go through. I hope there will be new laws to stop this pratice. I just wanted to help correct these errors,but everytime I sent the documents to some one, they stop talking to me.

Also if two or more owners cannot agree on what to do with a piece of property they may petition the court and the court will order a sale or refinancing etc. so that the one or more may get out of the property obligation and/or the other(s) may keep it etc.--it is often done--  (This is true in some cases even for equitable owners that have paid various amounts etc., but for various reasons, may not be on title.)

								We were renting a property, and found out July 28th it was in foreclosure. Long story short- the homeowner stopped communicating with us, stopped caring for the property as required in the lease, and refused to put our security deposit into a trust account (she was not required by FL law to hold it separately at lease signing). So we wrote and advised her to keep two months rent out of the security deposit and last month's rent we had given her at lease signing, gave our notice and we leased at a new property. I received notice from the attorney representing the bank, because we were listed as tenants, that they filed a motion for summary judgement. So I went on line to see exactly what was going on and I noticed in the court documents that the homeowner signed a ""Warranty Deed to Trustee"" back on June 13th (although it oddly wasn't filed at the court until mid October). The reason this is of interest to us is because the homeowner still owes us $1000 of the security deposit- she never made a claim against it in the allowed time frame. I am debating filing in small claims court and the only reason I haven't is because I doubt I would ever be able to collect. But what exactly does this Warranty Deed mean? Can she reassign the property ""free of all encumbrances"" while we had a lease with her? Should she even have collected the rent she did after that point?

								We were renting a property, and found out July 28th it was in foreclosure. Long story short- the homeowner stopped communicating with us, stopped caring for the property as required in the lease, and refused to put our security deposit into a trust account (she was not required by FL law to hold it separately at lease signing). So we wrote and advised her to keep two months rent out of the security deposit and last month's rent we had given her at lease signing, gave our notice and we leased at a new property. I received notice from the attorney representing the bank, because we were listed as tenants, that they filed a motion for summary judgement. So I went on line to see exactly what was going on and I noticed in the court documents that the homeowner signed a ""Warranty Deed to Trustee"" back on June 13th (although it oddly wasn't filed at the court until mid October). The reason this is of interest to us is because the homeowner still owes us $1000 of the security deposit- she never made a claim against it in the allowed time frame. I am debating filing in small claims court and the only reason I haven't is because I doubt I would ever be able to collect. But what exactly does this Warranty Deed mean? Can she reassign the property ""free of all encumbrances"" while we had a lease with her? Should she even have collected the rent she did after that point? It just seems like she is doing something completely shady here.

I'm not a lawyer, but if this was a true ""gift"" then that would mean no repayment. I would say it is highly unlikely that a lien can be put on the home.

								This farm in Minnesota was sold at a sheriff sale to satisfy a bank mortage with a one year redemption period. The bid price was more than the 1st mortage. I have a recorded judgement for equip. purchased by the farmer. Do I have a chance to get paid from the excess funds and how would I go about it?  Also as a mortage holder would I have the right to redeem the farm within the redemption period

I would like to start looking for another place now, but I am still in a lease. <br/>

Can I get out of my lease early due to the circumstances? There's no telling if my landlord even still has my security deposit. I don't want to keep giving my landlord money, if he's not paying the bank. What options to I have?<br/>

								My regards to the community, I would be seeking your advice on some matter. I have some interests in real estate and have read that foreclosure is an efficient way to gather up profits.

								Re: Can anyone explain me about foreclosure real estate investing????<br/>
<br/>
Foreclosure investing is really hotting up the scene nowadays. As more and more people are clearing off the debts by their property sale…..its a good way to capture some profits and quick ones too. Foreclosure profits are not only earned quickly but they are easy to earn also provided you know a foreclosure system. You just need a proper plan and way to go about it and then you can be good at judging the circumstances.

								Re: Can anyone explain me about foreclosure real estate investing????<br/>
<br/>
For pre-foreclosure, there are several ways. They include, note buying, short sales, and providing services to those at risks of foreclosure. As to how to do each, that's a bigger lesson than I can post here. You are better off learning which ever method you wish to work with. <br/>
<br/>
I run a real estate seminar list. You might find one that suits you.<br/>
<br/>
Also, be aware that foreclosure investing is also rehab investing. You will rarely find a foreclosure that doesn't need, at least minor rehab. Especially in today's market when buyers are looking for upgrades.

								If credit collection agencies put a lien on a house you own can they force a sale of the house and have you thrown out on the street?<br/>
Or can the lien just sit there on the house until if you ever sell it at all?<br/>
I never intend to sell the house but live there the rest of my life.<br/>
So exactly what can they do to me?  It is old debt from several years ago that i cant pay.
							
						</div>, <div class=""js-post__content-text restore h-wordwrap"" itemprop=""text"">
							
								
								re: Lien on house? Can they force a sale?<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple questions for you:<br/>
1. How much is the lien for? <br/>
2. Who was your old creditor (Credit card company, bank, etc.)?<br/>
3. What is your house worth?<br/>
4. What is the total amount owed on your property?<br/>
<br/>
They can force a sale but would only do so if it was in their best interest (If they make money). <br/>
<br/>
Example 1: If the lien is for a relatively small amount. No they would not foreclose. Their cost would exceed the amount they would be able to collect after attorney fees. <br/>
<br/>
Example 2: However, if your property has a lot of equity and their lien amount was significant they would possibly foreclose. <br/>
<br/>
Answer the questions above and I could give you some more information.

Depending on your lender, if your rate is about to adjust, you may be able to be approved for a loan modification. With a loan modification, you may be able to reduce your payment and/or the principal to an affordable amount. Call up your lender and request for a loan modification package.

								I think my house is unsellable for anything near a reasonable price. We've been trying to sell, on and off, since 5/2006. Our initial price was $549,000 and now we're down to $469,000. We owe $400,000. Our current appraisal is $435,000. We're in a residential/commercial area and everything negative related to this area is out of our control. The house next door is a home for men with developmental disabilities (i.e., mildly retarded guys). Next to that is an empty commercial building that is for sale by owner. The next building has a fence around it and will be demolished soon. There are 2 commercial buildings across the street that are empty and for sale. <br/>
<br/>
We are not in a position financially to sell our house for less than what we own on it. We also purchased our next home in 11/2006, so we've been paying 2 mortgages for a long time. <br/>
<br/>
Does it make sense to foreclose on the house we're trying to sell just to stop the bleeding? We really need some expert help!!!

								Re: Should I foreclose?<br/>

I think you should most definitely look into expert advice.  It is correct that lenders are starting to work with loan modification and loss mitigation services to negotiate interest rates for home owners in foreclosure.  There are alot of them out there but I was in a situation where I was way behind on payments.  My rate had adjusted from a 4.5 to an 11.50 and as you can imagine I was absolutely in the worst financial position imaginable.  It weighed on my marriage and i thought this was it.

								Re: Should I foreclose?<br/>
<br/>
<b>Use Accord and Satisfaction (a.k.a. Payment)<br/>
</b><br/>
Payment is the  defense to any foreclosure action, but it becomes much more<br/>
effective when you can actually prove that payments were made. Copies of canceled<br/>
checks are always of help and should be attached to you answer and labeled as Exhibits.<br/>
A foreclosure claim must be discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted<br/>
can prove that payment was made to the lender and accepted by the lender with no<br/>
dispute. If the bank has continued to accept your payments, they don’t have the right to<br/>
foreclose on your home for not paying.<br/>
<br/>
That's one tip, I was wondering if i could get your feedback. Im putting together a new course for homeowner's call ""How to Stop Foreclosure NOW,""<br/>
I really love you feedback on whats your #1 question is related to foreclosure as a homeowner.<br/>
<br/>
To say ""thank you"" for helping me out, you'll get a copy of new course before we release in into the market.(should be ready in a few weeks). This course will sell for between $79-$99, but ill share it with you for free just for giving me feedback.<br/>

Now my firind and I, both elderly want to buy a house and not put my name on it, only his, because the collection agencies would take the house if my name was on it. I would give him the $35,000 as a downpayment on a 30 year mortgage.  Now I need to know when he leaves the house to me in his will if he dies and it has a mortgage can I just take over the payments with my social security check? or can the collection agencies then take it and throw me out?<br/>
Would I have to qualify for a new mortgage to take over the payments as I could not qualify with that debt and bad credit?<br/>
I dont want to get in the house and then be thrown out with no where to go.<br/>
Please tll us how to arrange doing this

They could put a lien on the home if they sue and win after it goes into your name, and it would go into your name after he dies.<br/>

You may want to have a quick meeting with a reputable financial planner too.

I would not care if there was a lien on the house, as i am elderly 68, and dont ever plan to sell the house while I am alive, all that matters is that they cannot force me to sell it or take it away from me and throw me out into the street.<br/>
Just being able too stay there the rest of my life is what matters.<br/>
My only source of income is my social security check and that would pay a small mortgage.

								Re: Mortgage and debt?<br/>
<br/>
Given all the worries about credit in this country, and subprime mortgages, I was curious as to what the entire amount of home mortgage debt is. There are about 110 million households in the country, with 70% of them owned residences. Let's say there are 75 million owned homes. Not all have mortgages, but if 70 million do, and the average mortgage amount on such homes is $200,000, that comes out to a scary $14 TRILLION of mortgage debt in the USA. If just 2% default, the amount of bad home loans is $280 billion. It could obviously be much higher......Does anyone know what total mortgage debt is per household and in total? This is a real problem that could damage the economy........

processing this loan the lender then said he needed $13,000.00 in order to complete this process and close escrow before the sale  date.  there was no way i could get that kind of money (if i had that kind of money i wouldn't need this loan) since the date of sale was only 2 days away my only solution was to file bankruptcy and that would buy me 30 days just enough time to look for another finance company. i found another finance company i qualified and the loan docs were sent to me ready to sign. when the routine title search came back the results were devastating the lender i dealt with in june had recorded  an unauthorized fraudulent loan in the amount of $173,500.00  i never signed loan documents nor notarized documents my home had over $130,000.00 of equity do to that fraudulent recording i was unable to get this other company to    refinance the existing loan and i lost my home i need help a.s.a.p. thank you

								Recent approved short sale in Florida.  We had approval letter from lender when we closed.  Check in the amount approval was sent to lender prior to deadline (closed 7/28, lender received check 7/30 had until 7/31).  It is now 9/15 and the lender has not processed the check or closed the transaction.  We do not live in the house.  In fact, the new owners have a mortgage on the house with the same lender!  They say that between closing and receiving the check it was transferred back to Freddie Mac who insured the loan.  They say it was a trigger at so many days past due.  They say they cannot process the check or payoff until it is approved by Freddie.  Our credit is already horrible (we use to have 720+ scores) and is deteriorating even more with this past due debt.  What can we due?  Also, FL has a 30 day requirement from payoff to process Satisfaction of Mortgage.  Help???

I can not make the 2 mortgage payments that are due.I am almost 60 days behind. I had a loan remod. in April 08 on the leased property and am trying to get the bank to cont. to work with me. I have been told many things, My biggest concern is what to do with the defaulting property. I am told to short sale it, but it is a second porperty not my primary res. I am concerned with the 1099 tax liability. I know that the govt. is forgiving most on a primary res., but what about a second res.?  Would it be better to work out a deed in lieu of foreclosure if I could secure the details or poss. forclosure if they won't work with me?

								Re: should I foreclose, short sale or deed back?<br/>
<br/>
First you need to discuss your situation with your lender.  Tell them right up front you would like to do a short sale on your property.  They will look at your whole financial picture and tell you if they will even do a short sale.  If they will, then that is an option.  <br/>
Also, they may not be willing to do a deed in lieu of foreclosure.  You need to ask them about that.  Their goal will be to get you back on track, but if that is impossible it would be to their advantage to have you short sale it.  <br/>
Then you need to find a Loss Mitigation Firm that will negotiate with the mortgage co on your behalf to mitigate the deficiency you may be charged with whenever you do get an offer and then close on the property. But before you can get an offer you need to have it listed with a Realtor who specializes in short sale.  <br/>
If you need more info you can call me and we can discuss it in further detail.  While I may not be able to list your home I can point you in the right direction.  Each case is different.<br/>
Whatever you do, dont just do nothing, because you will bring the largest tax liability and deficiency judgement on yourself if you do nothing.  <br/>

								From VA:  My neighbor's condo was foreclosed on in January and then she declared bankruptcy in May (Chapter 7 was granted on August 7th).  The bank held the auction for the sale of the condo on August 10th.  Would it be legal for my former neighbor to buy her condo back at the foreclosure auction?  Due to her altered mental status, she might attempt to do it using an alias or to have a friend buy it for her.

								May I ask about a situation in Florida? Is it legal for someone to take title of a house and just take over the payments of the mortgage that is in place at the time? If so, is it legal for that person to then sell the property in a lease-option to buy? Then, if the person who holds the title and is paying the last homeowners mortgage (that is still in the last homeowners name) stops paying that mortgage and the home goes into foreclosure - what are the legal ramifications of that?<br/>
<br/>
I hope I made myself clear...thanks for the info.

for about 9 days and has never made any contribution to this house.  We are <br/>
trying to finance the balloon payment, but are getting refused because of <br/>
the community property law.  The time period for the balloon payment has <br/>
passed and we face losing our home unless we can gain financing for the <br/>
balloon payment.  Since Bill and Betty were never married and the contract <br/>
states \""or\"" is our home community property.  We have tried for months to <br/>
locate Betty, but have had no success.  We don\'t know what to do next.

								Hello,<br/>
A few years ago, my husband and I sought out assistance to save our home since I lost my job. I located a professional with good reference who promised to save us through a bailout process which will save our home, give us cash back and pay off creditors/debtors, etc.  A year later, we learned that this fool stole $85K in equity and our home. We were evicted this year since he stopped making payments on the home. Now we are displaced and have no where to turn. We have an attorney, but he hasn't done anything yet to prevent this hardshp.<br/>
Please help. Whom else should  we contact? I'm devastated and my child is very uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks

								Re: mortgage foreclosure bailout scam!<br/>
<br/>
Most in the same situation are renting until they build their credit back up and get past the situation, on a foreclosure you need to be at least 3 years past it with payments made to all tradelines of credit on time during those 3 yrs............it is obtaining a new "" mortgage loan"" that would be considered fraudulent.<br/>
<br/>
You can hire an attorney...National Association of Consumer Advocates &amp;#226;€“ Consumer Protection Advocates and Attorneys or try a non profit to help with the modification like HOPE at 1-888-995-HOPE. <br/>
<br/>
If you are going through the modification process with Chase, they are modifying most of their loans as long as you can show that you can afford the modification going forward........
