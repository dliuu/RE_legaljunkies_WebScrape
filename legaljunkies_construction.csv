								I live in an HOA community in ID. The lots were originally platted in 2008. In 2015, the developer who owns and lives in the development decided to replat a few lots by making them bigger, and removing some of the community property. In 2019, I purchased one of those lots with future plans to build a new home. While developing a floorplan, we discovered that the electrical pad vault was positioned right in the middle of where the driveway would be located. In other words, prior to the replat of the lots, the vault was located at the lot line (in the utility easement) where you always see them in residential neighborhoods. When the developer re-platted the lot to make it larger, the lot line moved some 12 feet, but the vault was not relocated to the new lot line. Was and is this the developer’s responsibility to relocate the vault so that it does not interfere with ingress and egress via the future driveway? Thank you for any info on this topic.

								When it comes to determining the responsibility for relocating utilities, including an electrical pad vault, it usually depends on various factors, including local laws, regulations, HOA rules, and the specific circumstances surrounding the replatting of the lots.<br/>
<br/>
In general, when a developer replats lots and makes changes to the layout of the community, they are typically responsible for ensuring that any existing utilities or infrastructure are appropriately relocated to accommodate the new lot configuration. This responsibility may include moving utility structures, such as electrical pad vaults, to ensure they do not obstruct the future development or use of the property.<br/>
<br/>
However, it's essential to review the governing documents of your HOA, such as the Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&amp;Rs) and any applicable local laws and regulations. These documents may provide specific guidelines regarding the responsibility for relocating utilities during replatting or address how disputes related to these matters should be resolved.<br/>
<br/>
It would be advisable to also consult with a local real estate attorney who can review the relevant documents and provide you with specific advice based on your situation. They will be able to assess the legal obligations of the developer and guide you on how to proceed if the developer has failed to fulfill their responsibilities.<br/>

								Hello<br/>
<br/>
New to the forum and hoping to get some insight on an issue I have. I live in Michigan in a township with property setback rules.<br/>
<br/>
I recently built a garage that violates those rules. My neighbor is being very understanding and we've discussed ways to get around the violation. One thought we had was for him to grant me an easement whereby the building would no longer be less than the 10ft requirement away from the property line since the easement would artificially move that line.<br/>
<br/>
Are we on to something here or is that not how an easement works?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance. <br/>
<br/>
</div>, <div class=""js-post__content-text restore h-wordwrap"" itemprop=""text"">
							
								
								You've stumbled on to the right person for that question. I have built 4 free standing garages in homes that I have owned, the last one being a 3 car garage in my current back yard. I am painfully familiar with setback requirements, having had to comply with them in all the builds<br/>
<br/>
An easement is not the solution. Without even reading your local codes I can postulate that your setbacks refer to ""property lines."" Those property lines won't change with an easement. You'll still be in non-compliance.<br/>
<br/>
There are two ways that I can think of to bring you into compliance. There may be others but only two come to mind.<br/>
<br/>
1 - Apply for a variance. You can do that, even after the fact.<br/>
<br/>
2 - Have your neighbor deed you a strip of his property wide enough to bring you into compliance. That moves the property line. Both lots will have to be re-surveyed and re-platted and the legal descriptions updated in the county or township records.<br/>
<br/>
That brings me to my question.<br/>
<br/>
How did you manage to get a building permit without complying with the setback requirements?<br/>
<br/>
Or did you build it without a permit?

								I have about 300 feet of public road frontage on my farm. The frontage begins just after a sharp curve in the public road. At least twice a year, drivers come too fast through the curve and crash through my agricultural fencing. So far, no people or livestock have been killed, but at least one person has required helicopter medevac, the damage is always extensive, and cattle have escaped. VDOT (I live in Virginia) refuses to install a guardrail, despite my property having attracted local television news attention for the frequency of these wrecks. In Virginia, am I legally able to install concrete Jersey barriers along this road frontage (between the road and my fence, but well within my property lines and not in the VDOT right-of-way) to prevent my property, fencing, livestock, and farm workers from damage and death? If a driver wrecked into the barriers and sued me, would a court rule against me for creating some sort of undue risk to drivers due to my installation of these barriers?
							
						</div>, <div class=""js-post__content-text restore h-wordwrap"" itemprop=""text"">
							
								
								In Virginia, property owners generally have the right to use and control their land, subject to applicable laws and regulations. If the concrete Jersey barriers are installed entirely within your property lines and not within the VDOT right-of-way, it is likely that you have the legal right to install them.<br/>
<br/>
However, if a driver were to crash into the barriers and sue you, the court could consider various factors, including whether the barriers were installed in a reasonably safe manner and whether they created an unreasonable risk to drivers. The court may also consider whether VDOT had previously refused to install a guardrail and whether there were any alternative solutions to address the safety issue.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, while you may have the legal right to install the barriers, it is important to carefully consider the potential risks and legal implications before doing so. Consulting with an attorney can help you better understand your rights and obligations and make an informed decision.<br/>

State of Texas demands for license to drill water well on one’s own land. You will get license from the concerned licensing authority.

I state the following as I am seeking the same information. I have been told this by several DIY water rig manufacturers. That if there is no contract labor a land owner may personally drill a well on his or her own property as long as the well is not contracted and no one recieves compensation for the well. If you are in the business for drilling for money, you would need a license. They say that the Texas Department of Regulations and Licensing can provide the literature to support this. I am waiting on a response from them at this time.

<span style=""color:#000000"">Construction of wells and the operator's license <br/>
<br/>
While an operator license is required for all construction activities and the dismantling of these categories of wells: <br/>
<br/>
Water Wells <br/>
Monitoring wells <br/>
Geotech soil drilling <br/>
Environmental research wells <br/>
Drilling geothermal heat pump <br/>
Drainage Systems <br/>
<br/>
There are two situations that do not require this license: <br/>
<br/>
1. When drilling a water well on his property for non-consumptive use have more than once every two years. The well must meet all building codes and regulations and be built by the owner of real property. There is no exemption for closing wells. A homeowner must hire a licensed driller Washington State as well. <br/>
2. When drilling is done by a licensed engineer, architect or surveyor registered in the state of Washington, provided the construction and closing state regulations are met, and the inspector engineer, architect or land is on the site during construction and decommissioning activities. <br/>
<br/>
There are several ways to qualify for a license. Refer to the Good of Washington publication of the Program for the specific requirements of the operator. The applicant must meet the requirements of the Program Guide Well operator in Washington and pass a written and available at the test site.</span>

To Jim Ray:  <br/>
<br/>
A LANDOWNER DOES NOT NEED A LICENSE FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS TO DRILL HIS OWN WELL. <br/>
<br/>
A definitive exception from licensing requirements for a land owner to drill a water well for his/her own use or consumption is contained in SECTION 76.300, TITLED: EXEMPTIONS, as published in the Texas Dept of Licensing &amp; Regulations, Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 76, effective date of December 1, 2006.

You really need to call County authorities, the restrictions and permissions very widely in Texas. It is likely you can drill your own well, but due to the variance throughout the state of Texas it's imperative to contact county officials.

As far as I know, it is legal to drill a water well on your own land in Texas without a license. However, you need to follow some rules and regulations to ensure you're doing it safely and correctly. One thing to keep in mind is the type of drilling rig you use. Have you considered using a </span><a href=""https://upet.com/equipment/swivels/"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color:#000000"">swivel in drilling rig</span></a><span style=""color:#000000"">?

								I live on the New Jersey shore in a great neighborhood. Only four houses on my block with woods across the street and wetlands 125 feet to the right and directly behind me. About a year ago we were surprised to find someone was going to build on one of the lots behind my property. A property that had a standing pond on it. Fast forward one year. They have filled the property, built a beautiful home, and now when it rains I get water creeping on my property ten feet on two sides. I have never had water on my property. Additionally, a 150 foot section of the street now floods. That has also never happened. Not to mention my neighbor, who already had flooding issues, cannot even walk to his front steps because of the ankle high water on his whole property. The builder has dug swails which seemed to make a bad problem worse. I am just not sure there is anywhere for the water to go because we are are only about 12"" above the water table. My neighbors and I have been in contact with the new neighbors (who I feel awful for), the builder, his engineer, and the township engineer. So far, no solutions. I am open for any suggestions. As far as legal action against the builder, I am told I cannot name him in a lawsuit without including the new homeowner. Not sure if that is true but I feel like I am running out of options.

								Re: Neighbor's construction flooding my property.<br/>
<br/>
One always has options. You and your neighbor need to contact an hydraulics engineeer to inspect the property, what was done, how much the grade was changed to cause runoff onto your properties. The counties often have aerial views of all property in the county and the engineer should be able to tell how much filling the pond and changing the grade caused the drainage/runoff problem. Water as you describe is going to be a continuing, ongoing problem so it needs to be remedied. The hydraulics engineer should be able to design a cure to the problem and give you an estimate of the cost. <br/>
<br/>
Then contact a real estate attorney (who litigates), to advise you of your remedies. <br/>
<br/>
The neighbor caused the problem by hiring a contractor or contractors to fill the pond, change the grade, and turned vegetation to non permeable surfaces (roof, driveway, walkways) and you and your neighbor are suffering the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
Your choices are to ask your neighbor and his workmen to cure the problem, pay for the remedy the engineer (and maybe township, too, since he's flooding the road). Perhaps his insurance will pay or he may choose to do so with or without the contractor's contribution. If not, you may then seek your remedy through the courts.<br/>
<br/>
One always has options. Yours are to remedy the continual, ongoing water problem to your property [reduces valuation, so you are suffering economic as well as physical damage] OR, do nothing. And take the financial bath.

								Re: Neighbor's construction flooding my property.<br/>
<br/>
Contact the city office that issued the building permit and/or the firm that did the construction.<br/>
If the firm caused it they can be held liable.<br/>
Neighbors can't construct (even on their own land) such that it then dumps it all on, unreasonably drains on, or damages, your property.

								Re: Neighbor's construction flooding my property.<br/>

Or sue the neighbor in small claims or regular court.<br/>
They can't construct on their land so that it then floods yours.<br/>
I sued my neighbor in CA for exactly the same issue, and won!

All reputable drive way construction companies know you cannot drain onto a neighbor's property.

Have city officials look at it as well. Did he have a building permit, if it was needed? It would be needed where I live.

The company that put in the driveway may also be liable if they were negligent, and they likely are required to have insurance as well. At least they could help resolve the problem.

Same situation: <br/>
I assume I can sue the butthead in small claims court right?<br/>
He built a new shed that clearly pushed all the uphill water onto our property. Thoughtless fool. He denies it has caused any issue.<br/>

You can see the path after a big rain.<br/>

								Oh, what an unpleasant situation, I'm so sorry. Unfortunately, some neighbors don't think about the people living around them. Last year my neighbor had more than a ton of construction coal delivered to him, but the truck driver got the wrong address and unloaded the coal next to my gate. I wasn't home at that moment, I didn't know what to do when I got back. The neighbor said to let the coal stay near my gate, he would pick it up later. After 2 weeks, the situation has not changed and I had to rent a construction container <a href=""https://www.186needabin.com/disposal-bins/"" target=""_blank"">186needabin.com</a> to take this coal to his site. I wasted my money and my time on someone else's problems, is that fair? Maybe you should try to discuss the issue with your neighbors and tell them that they caused your land to flood.

They had me sign a contract that did not have any costs on it. They asked that my insurance company investigate and for me to supply to them the scope of services and the dollar amount they are willing to pay out for the claim. On this paper there is a clause that states that of I don't use them, i must pay them &amp;1500.00 for truly doing nothing. There was no 3-day right to cancel. I signed this form in late November.

A contract for repairs without a price is worthless and most likely invalid, for starters. Clearly, they intend to profiteer on the insurance claim and would base their bid on what the adjuster authorized.

								We are considering purchasing a home which was recently completely renovated including a new kitchen, all new siding/windows, new roof, reconstruction of an indoor pool converted to two large rooms, radiant heating added throughout and complete renovation of 3 bathrooms.  We just go the seller's disclosure statement and it indicates that no permits or inspections were obtained for these renovations.  The borough the house is located in does require building/renovation permits.  How do we go about making an offer, but also making certain the offer is contingent on the seller's obtaining &amp; closing all permits/inspections as part of the agreement?

I wish to inform you that if you purchase a house which has renovated in violation of requirement of permit then this may cause expense to you. In this your area local laws will govern your status. As you will be the owner of house thus you may be held liable for violation of building permit. If any fine or other penalty is fixed then you may have to pay for such penalty.

As the house is renovated in violation of permits or inspections, will definitely a liability for you if you buy the same. You may approach the municipal authorities for clearing off the permit violations. If you buy the house without curing the permit defects, then as the owner you will be held liable for permit violations.

								Re: Buying a house which was renovated with no permits/inspections<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if this makes sense? But why don't you just ask the sellers or builders to get everything certified and verified before you make an offer? I'm sure they will need the certifications to make sure that it's structurally sound in all the rooms and storage areas for anyone else who might be interested too right? At the same time, if you really like the place, thene you can try bidding less and telling them your concerns are what prevents you from bidding higher for the place.

								We are considering purchasing a home which was recently completely renovated including a new kitchen, all new siding/windows, new roof, reconstruction of an indoor pool converted to two large rooms, radiant heating added throughout and complete renovation of 3 bathrooms.  We just go the seller's disclosure statement and it indicates that no permits or inspections were obtained for these renovations.  The borough the house is located in does require building/renovation permits.  How do we go about making an offer, but also making certain the offer is contingent on the seller's obtaining &amp; closing all permits/inspections as part of the agreement?  What wording is typically used in the purchase agreement?

								Re: Buying a house which was renovated with no permits/inspections<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that if you purchase a house which has renovated in violation of requirement of permit then this may cause expense to you. In this your area local laws will govern your status. As you will be the owner of house thus you may be held liable for violation of building permit. If any fine or other penalty is fixed then you may have to pay for such penalty. You may thus purchase house keeping your future liability in consideration. <br/>

								My husband and I completely renovated our home last year. We have a one year contract with our general contractor to come in and fix any issues/problems with construction. The downstairs floor was stained and sealed concrete and started peeling off, exposing cement. Other issues were minor cracks, leaks, etc. The contractor bought and paid for new floor material (tile) and the repairs started Monday, September 8th. I cant not be around the construction dust or material, since i am on bed-rest due to high risk pregnancy. Meanwhile we have to stay at Residence Inn with two of our dogs for and estimated 10 day period. My question is - is my contractor financially responsible for our hotel accommodations?<br/>

								Re: Construction repairs and hotel accommodations<br/>

I wish to inform you that the terms and conditions stated in your contract will have jurisdiction in this matter. First of all you may try and resolve the matter mutually with the contractor. If the matter is not resolved then you may serve a written notice to the contractor for breach of contract. Finally, if the matter remains unresolved then you may file a lawsuit in the Small Claims Court. You may provide photographs, copy of the contract, copies of hotel bills, etc. to support your view point in the Court. You may appoint an attorney or self represent in the Court. You may only demand reasonable compensation. The burden to prove the breach of contract, expenses incurred, etc. will be on you in the Court. The Court will consider all the facts and decide the matter.<br/>

								Thank you for your reply. Unfortunately, I can not live in our home during the repairs. The whole first floor is being repaired, with all appliances removed.

								re: contractor scam (tree service, insurance money)<br/>
<br/>
You should never assign insurance money to a contractor. But that having been said, notify your state licensing board about the contractor's conduct so you can get the contract revoked. Contractors such as roofers need to be licensed and most states require a bond, too. That is the first step I would take and then a lawyer to get the matter straightened out and your money for the insurance claim so you can get the work done. Unscrupulous contractors and bogus contractors come out of the woodwork after storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters. Prosecutors often file criminal cases against them, too.

								I had a contract for renovation of the apt signed on May 2011. The renovation according to the contract was supposed to be completed for three weeks after management approval. The management approved the renovation in July and the work started 22 july, and the contractor did not finnish the work even after three months. Since i couldnt wait I hired another contractor for some work to be done, even though it was written in the contract that they were supposed to complete the work. <br/>
Since it is writeen in the contract that the work woll be completed in three weeks it means that they breached the contract right?<br/>

I wish to inform you that you can file a suit for breach of contract. In this regard there was a contract which has been breached because delay was much more then the duration of contract. Thus you may claim the damage which has been suffered by you. All the direct damages which have resulted by breach of contract can be claimed by you. <br/>

								Hello, I hired a contractor to some renovation work at my house. He was to reshingle my roof and replace all the soffit and fascia. <br/>
The colour of the shingles were totally wrong and still installed them. He knew the colour was wrong but went ahead anyways hoping we might like the new colour.<br/>
Second, he was to remove exisitng siding in a manner that would allow me to replce it once the soffit and fascia work was completed by this contractor. It was wood siding, this contractor took a hammer and crow bar to the wood siding and basically split every piece of wood siding which I have now had to replace and restain.<br/>
Third, this contractor was to repair all the wood required to accept the new soffit and fascia, he installed all the new aluminum work over the exisiting rotted wood. the seamless eaves were installed with a huge horizontal low spot which prevents the water from entering the downspout. The rain water overflows the new eaves in this low spot.<br/>
I kicked him of my property and sent him a registered letter explaing why I pulled the contract from him. I even gave him a deficiency compliance list which he failed to remedy.<br/>
Question is: Do I have to pay him or do I have to take him to small claims court as so this does not come back to haunt me.<br/>

</div>
</div>First, I would have a duly licensed, reputable contractor come in to inspect the work and give you a written estimate to repair it.  Sounds like a major, major job.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, not paying his bill for shoddy work is a given.  You may have grounds to sue him for what it will cost to repair the things he has done wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Check with your province licensing agency to see if he has bond posted, too,for if so you may have to go after his bond for the damages.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have your estimate, and more than one would be better, you can take him to court for the damages and, of course, relief from the contract.

								Re: Ontario Canada - Contractor did fulfill contract, should I pay him?<br/>
<br/>
Well it sounds like you got a bad contractor and did the right thing by firing him !  "" now you need to get at least 2 quotes for the cost of fixing the mess the bad contractor made "" then you can file a claim against the bad contractor in court to try to get the money to fix the mess !<br/>
    This being said -- good luck getting any money from the bad contractor to fix his mess !<br/>
<br/>
         Here is my advice when you go to fix the mess : <br/>
1) make it clear what work is to be done and what materials are to be used --- be shure that info in in the contract before signing it !<br/>
2) take the time to see the work is beeing done according to the contract !<br/>
3) always keep a couple of copys of the contract put away !<br/>
---- I haveseen were bad contractors have gone through the home ownes stuff to take off with the home owners copy of the original contract !

<div class=""message"">Hello, I hired a contractor to some renovation work at my house. He was to reshingle my roof and replace all the soffit and fascia. <br/>
The colour of the shingles were totally wrong and still installed them. He knew the colour was wrong but went ahead anyways hoping we might like the new colour.<br/>
Second, he was to remove exisitng siding in a manner that would allow me to replce it once the soffit and fascia work was completed by this contractor. It was wood siding, this contractor took a hammer and crow bar to the wood siding and basically split every piece of wood siding which I have now had to replace and restain.<br/>
Third, this contractor was to repair all the wood required to accept the new soffit and fascia, he installed all the new aluminum work over the exisiting rotted wood. the seamless eaves were installed with a huge horizontal low spot which prevents the water from entering the downspout. The rain water overflows the new eaves in this low spot.<br/>
I kicked him of my property and sent him a registered letter explaing why I pulled the contract from him. I even gave him a deficiency compliance list which he failed to remedy.<br/>
Question is: Do I have to pay him or do I have to take him to small claims court as so this does not come back to haunt me.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>First, I would have a duly licensed, reputable contractor come in to inspect the work and give you a written estimate to repair it.  Sounds like a major, major job.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, not paying his bill for shoddy work is a given.  You may have grounds to sue him for what it will cost to repair the things he has done wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Check with your province licensing agency to see if he has bond posted, too,for if so you may have to go after his bond for the damages.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have your estimate, and more than one would be better, you can take him to court for the damages and, of course, relief from the contract.

								Re: Ontario Canada - Contractor did fulfill contract, should I pay him?<br/>
<br/>
Well it sounds like you got a bad contractor and did the right thing by firing him !  "" now you need to get at least 2 quotes for the cost of fixing the mess the bad contractor made "" then you can file a claim against the bad contractor in court to try to get the money to fix the mess !<br/>
    This being said -- good luck getting any money from the bad contractor to fix his mess !<br/>
<br/>
         Here is my advice when you go to fix the mess : <br/>
1) make it clear what work is to be done and what materials are to be used --- be shure that info in in the contract before signing it !<br/>
2) take the time to see the work is beeing done according to the contract !<br/>
3) always keep a couple of copys of the contract put away !<br/>
---- I haveseen were bad contractors have gone through the home ownes stuff to take off with the home owners copy of the original contract !

								Our house is 1 1/2 yrs old. We have complained about the defects in the laminate wood floors by Bruce Hardwood that Ryland Homes installed since we moved in. They have given us the run around and now I feel legal action is needed. They constantly change their story. We have had them, the Bruce rep and a group they brought to assess the floor. They originally said 10 pieces need replaced. Then they said it's not the wood floor , it's the installation that's causing them to crack . Now today, the are saying 2 pieces because as the Bruce rep stated back in April...they discontinued this floor. Ryland only has 2 pieces to fix it and won't take the areas up and level the floor. They only want to cut the piece out and glue a piece in for 2 places. We stated that the floor is brand new and that is a temporary fix that voids the warranty on that piece. They don't care! The 1 piece they tried to fix that way already has broken and broke the 2 pieces next to it. Even the floor rep said a reputable company would take it up and fix it correctly. Ryland doesn't want to hear anything about it and hung up on my husband who has yet to lose his temper.HELP! What do we do? What type of lawyer do I hire? Can I recoup the costs of the lawyer when we win? My husband has lost work time since they refuse to accomodate our schedule even after all this inconvenience.

								Virginia - General District Court.  We were served a Warrant on Debt for a dispute over a remodeling contract (take a look at my other post for the gory details).<br/>
<br/>
We went for the initial hearing where his attorney was directed to file a Bill of Particulars and mail a copy to us by a specific deadline.  We were then to file our Grounds of Defense with the Court and provide a copy to his attorney.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that deadline came and went today with no Bill of Particulars arriving via mail, courier, or any other means.  Tomorrow I am going down to the courthouse to see if they received a copy.<br/>
<br/>
If they did, should I inform them I never received a copy as ordered by the court ask them for a copy?  If the court receives theirs but I do not, have they violated the court order?<br/>
<br/>
If the court did not get a copy, what is the next step - do I still need to file a Grounds of Defense with the court, and if so do I also provide one to the opposing attorney even though I have no Bill of Particulars to base it on?  <br/>
<br/>
Or, in either case  do I just go to court on the date of trial and request dismissal for the plaintiff failing to adhere to court order by not providing my copy on or before the deadline date?<br/>
<br/>
What if the Bill of Particulars arrives a day later in my mailbox?  Is this something I should bring to the attention of the court to support a request for dismissal?  Throughout this ordeal the other side has repeatedly provided inaccurate paperwork and at times shown an unawareness of or unwillingness to comply with regulations and standards governing his supposed ""profession.""<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your consideration.

<br/>
I wish to inform you that you can obtain a default judgment if bill of particulars is not filed in court. In case you have not been served on you or late served then you can object on the ground that court order has been violated thus it should not be accepted. You can always inform court about deficiency of other party so that judge can pass judgment in your favor. <br/>

</div>You can check the court dockets online for most maintain dockets (registers of actions) online for their civil cases.<br/>
<br/>
If the plaintiff has not filed a bill of particulars, the specifics of the complaint, of course you cannot file a defense.  A move to dismiss can be tried.  But if the court denies that request, it is appropriate to request the court move all dates forward, extend your time to answer and extend the trial date.<br/>
<br/>
A party has a duty to serve all papers filed with the court.  The other party is under no compulsion to go to court to get copies from the files.<br/>
<br/>
What one could do is ask the court for sanctions, monetary sanctions, for the lawyer's failure to serve timely.  You can ask for sanctions for ever breach of court rules.  That should make the lawyer sit up and take notice.  Some, when they have a layman without lawyer on the other side, take advantage -- if they can get away with it.

<b>Background:</b> I own a home with my ex-wife. We were divorced just over 2 years ago, and at the time, the home was placed on the market, sat for 10 months, and just wouldn't sell for any less than a catastrophic loss, so it was leased. The divorce decree states that we each own 50% of the home and property. <br/>
<br/>
We're getting ready to put it back on the market when the renters move out, and my ex-wife recently went out to the house with her family and planted sod and repaired sprinklers. The cost of materials and ""paying helpers"" was over $1000, which isn't horrible, but I had estimates to have the job done professionally for only around $1250, and actually had another contractor scheduled to come out and estimate today which could possibly have been less as I was referred to him by other customers. I had told her when she brought up the idea that I would prefer to know that it was done correctly by professionals, in addition to the fact that, though she asked if I would pay half for her to have it done, I never agreed to it as she never gave any kind of estimation of what it would cost to ""do it ourselves."" She asked, we discussed - me asking her if they had the necessary tools or knowledge, how much would it cost, etc. I then asked a few days later, after sending her an estimate from one contractor that I had look at it last year, and asked again if they had any plan or idea what she was wanting to do... was told ""we're looking into it"" - then 3 days later I get an email saying it's done and cost over 1K.<br/>
<br/>
<b>The issue:</b> I have no issue paying for half of the materials that they used, sod, wiring, mulch, etc. However, they spent $150 buying new and nice brand garden tools ($30 common shovels and rakes), tools which they likely already had, or could have been given to them if she had let me know they were needed - and I'm sure they bought because they will last far beyond this one-time job. They also spent $200 paying (feeding her 5 family members) the ""help"" - this one may be a personal prejudice, as part of the reason I didn't really want her family doing it is that I've seen their work, it's very sloppy and often has to be redone by professionals. In addition, my own family spent several weekends cleaning the home, pressure washing, shampooing carpets, etc after she left it a mess when she moved out and it was put on the market the first time around, and she never paid a dime for that.<br/>
<br/>
<b>The question:</b> Am I obligated to pay for all portions of the cost that she sent me if I didn't agree to them (wasn't even notified of amount being paid, or what was being paid for) beforehand? It seems to me that buying new tools that clearly aren't for one-time use, and paying your family to do the job to the point that it costs nearly the same as professionals isn't right. I would like to simply return to her an itemized list of what I will pay half for, which will include all of the essential materials etc and likely be around 800. My concern is that in 2 months the renters move out and at that point we are responsible for the mortgage, which I usually write the check for, and she pays me her half... I know that she will attempt to hold the amount ""hostage"" and simply take it out of what she owes for the mortgage if I refuse to pay it now. What is my recourse, am I stuck simply paying half of what she had done?

								Re: Cost of repairs/additions in a co-owned home (ex-spouse)<br/>
<br/>
Although it is a question on construction and renovation, the root issue has to do with who pays in a shared property issue.  It appears that would be best addressed in the Family Law section where the second thread was posted here:<br/>

								We live in Virginia and contracted with a General Contractor to perform bathroom remodeling in our home.  Specifically asked if permits would be required and he replied No, as we were only doing one-for-one replacements.  (even though shower was being moved to new area of bathroom, new drains and pipes were being installed, etc).<br/>
<br/>
During remodel our safe was stolen from our house and in the course of the investigation it was determined a worker of a sub-contractor stole the safe (a few items were recovered which were traced to that worker).  An arrest warrant was put out for that individual.  Our contract was only with the general contractor.<br/>
<br/>
Also during the investigation it was determined by police that our key was reproduced (without our knowledge or consent) and multiple copies were distributed to sub-contractors and even left outside overnight for the convenience of the workers.  (At contract signing the contractor said he would be responsible for letting workers in, reviewing their work, supervising, and locking up at night.)<br/>
<br/>
Further, we became aware 3 months after work started that an electrical and plumbing permit were required by VA Code and local code, PRIOR to work being started.<br/>
<br/>
We terminated the contract for failure to supervise, negligence, jeopardizing our safety, and most importantly, failure to secure required permits as was his responsibility as noted on the contract.<br/>
<br/>
His argument is that permits are the Sub-contractor responsibility, he is not responsible for their workers' activity, and we did not have anything in writing saying he couldn't make extra keys.<br/>
<br/>
We just settled with his insurance for the contents of the safe, and now he is taking us to court for payment in full, plus interest for the contract (about $18k).  He says we broke the contract.  We maintain that we terminated for just cause, had paid all invoices that were provided to us on or before termination date, and said we would pay any actual costs from the last invoice to the date of theft, when work was stopped.  He repeatedly has provided inaccurate invoices that did not properly reflect credits and continued to ask for payment in full.<br/>
<br/>
The $18k question is - did I have sufficient right to terminate the contract over the permits and other issues (I ended up having to request permits myself and the inspections were done despite all electrical and plumbing already being covered up by tile or sheetrock)?<br/>
<br/>
If I was within rights to terminate, what costs am I liable for?  Costs of any completed work that we were not yet invoiced for?  Cost plus profit for completed work not invoiced?  Payment in full to include his profit?  Interest?  What about lawyer fees (he's asking for 33 1/3 % of his lawyers fees, per the terms of the contract)?  Are the costs I incurred to complete the project able to be used to offset his claim?  <br/>
<br/>
He has not placed a lien against us and the time has expired for him to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I maintain he violated the contract first, we identified a pattern of unprofessional and illegal behavior, and we justifiably terminated the contract and provided him with notice. <br/>
<br/>
A lawyer colleague has said since this is in the lower court, we are well served representing ourselves as we retain the right to appeal to the next higher level. I am okay with this as we have our facts in a row and have retained all email on the subject which is pretty compelling against him. I'm just not sure how the judge will see this.<br/>
<br/>
Just trying to mentally prepare myself for what lies ahead.  Appreciate any assistance!

								Re: Justified Contract Termination for Cause?<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that in terms of breach of contract court considers which party has breached contract and conduct of each party in contract is taken into consideration. In your case you can argue that contract was terminated because other party had failed to perform its obligation and hence breach of contract is actually committed by other party. You may thus not be held liable for anything. Lastly in matter of breach of contract damages or loss arising directly from contract is paid by party at fault. <br/>

								Re: Justified Contract Termination for Cause?<br/>
<br/>
If the work the contractor was to do required permit first --and he commenced work without obtaining the required permits, then his work was illegal and he is not entitled to any compensation. The contract was illegal because of the manner in which he intended to perform it. Illegal contracts cannot be enforced and they are construed against the one who drew the contract.<br/>
<br/>
Often when work is done without permit, it may have to be torn out and redone -- with proper inspections along the way. You may wish to check out this line of defense for lower court, small claims I assume if you can have a trial de novo at a superior court.

Thanks to both replies written in plain language!  The building codes are quite specific to that matter and so that's what we are banking on.<br/>
When we found out, we directed the inspections and had permits pulled and the inspectors did after-the-fact inspections rather than forcing everything to be ripped out.<br/>
<br/>
I believe our conduct all along has been in good faith and hope to show a pattern of deception by him from start to termination of the contract.

								MN - I recently damaged a neighbor's fence and want to make things right.  I notified them and they went out and got a bid for repairs to the fence.  After seeing the bid, I told them I was not happy with it since the labor charged seemed extremely high.  My neighbor had the work done anyway, before I could get a second and or third opinion.  My first question is this:  am I liable for paying that bid even though I never approved it? <br/>
My second question is this.  The bid does not actually match the work done.  For example, the bid specifically states  a cost for two new fence panels.  However, the actual work done was only 2 new rails and  2 new pickets on the fence.  I queried the builder and he said the cost would be the same either way which just does not make sense.  So, How liable am I for a bid that does not represent the actual work done?

								re: Liability for inaccurate bid?<br/>

I suggest you get your own bid. Was the labor and material bid together or separate? Did each picket need to be removed and reinstalled separately to the new rails?

</div>You ARE obligated to pay the neighbor for the work that needed to be done, but they can use whatever contractor they wish to do the work.  They aren't required to get your approval before proceeding.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel that the work done does not accurately represent the bid presented to estimate the job, you can certainly get other contractors to provide you an alternate estimates, and then reimburse your neighbor based upon one of those estimates.  If your neighbor doesn't agree with what you pay, they can always sue you in small claims court to recover the difference.  If that happens, be armed and ready with at least a couple of alternate estimates for the cost of the work already completed.

Great feedback, and I thank you.  I really want to set this right with the neighbor, but I think what happened is that the contractor assumed I would send this to the insurance company and just padded the bill.  I just don't want to pay for work that was not done.   I will admit to being surprised that the neighbor can arbitrarily decide what to get done without regards to a reasonable cost, but hey, learn something new right?<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>

								Me, my husband and my two children live in the town houses for eighteen years since 1994. Now, our bathroom is leaking, water leaking from upstair bathroom to downstair lounge room. It is quite serious. We are forwarding our insurance claim form to our Body Corporate, who acts on our behalf, will forwards the claim form to the insurance company. Do we need to prepare the public liability claim and the letter of demand, and if so, where do we obtain it and what do we need to state in the public liability claim and the letter of demand?

I wish to inform you that you must study the public liability claims manual of your body corporate for detailed instructions and formats for preparation of the public liability claim and the letter of demand. Public Liability is part of the law of torts which focuses on civil wrongs. The claims are under common law based on negligence and/or damages. Claims are usually successful when it can be shown that the duty of care was breached.<br/>

								We have a neighbor who is a licensed pool contractor who offer to do us a favor by helping finish our pool when the previous contractor left without notice.  There was no formal contract and no final price was mentioned.  We purchased all the materials and he brought in an electrician and plumber to finish up what was left and then he did some tile work.  He had mentioned prior to finishing that he wanted 10 to 15% as a contractors fee for the labor and supplies of the pool.  My husband said he would have to look at the budget.  The pool was finished but had not had the final inspection yet and the neighbor was going to vacation and asked for his fee which he said was 20%.  We did not want to pay him in full no matter the percent since the inspection was not final.  We said we could only give him $2000.00.  When he came back from his vaction and the inspection was complete he stated we now owe him $4000.00 for his fee.  We stated we already paid him $2000.00 and so paid him another $2050.00.  He took that and then came back and siad we still owe him another $2000.00 because the first $2000.00 before his vaction was for labor not his fee.  He has now contacted our realtor threatening to put a lien on the house because he knows we are trying sell.  He has not notified us yet.  What is our best course of action at this point?

								re: construction lien (licensed pool contractor)<br/>
<br/>
As a fellow Contractor,<br/>
<br/>
This contractor had better not file any sort of lien any ware. As a Contractor he is supposed to have all work in writing and is supposed to have all insurances ETC.<br/>
<br/>
If he does file a lien you will have many resources such as filing a fraudulent lean and being sued for holding up the sale of your home stress ETC<br/>
<br/>
I suggest you speak with a real estate attorney or construction or contract attorney.<br/>
<br/>
By the way did you get lean releases for all the people who did work?<br/>
Where they licensed did they have the necessary insurance ETC.<br/>
<br/>
(DO NOT PAY HIM ANY MORE UNTIL YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO AN ATTORNEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

I wish to inform you that if mortgage agreement was formed with a view that further site plan development agreement will be made then mortgage company is at fault and when mortgage company refused to sign site plan development agreement then they have committed breach of contract. If the mortgage agreement was independent of your site plan development agreement then you cannot force mortgage company to enter into contract. Further mortgage company can only claim the amount of loss which creditor company has suffered. <br/>

								My house was finished (new construction) and purchased 3/31/2006.  I had several problems with the construction and the builder did not fix any of them for 1.5 years.  Finally, I took him to court and won a settlement to have the repairs done myself.  Now, my water main is leaking through a wall.  It is still within the four year time period allowed for plumbing, foundation, walls, water leakage, etc by California Code, section 896.<br/>
<br/>
MY QUESTION IS:  since I already won a settlement for construction related issues, can I still take him back to court for a settlement on this newly arisen issue, or does everything have to be settled in one case--even though this problem had not surfaced yet, at the time?<br/>
<br/>
(It was obviously past the point of having him do the repairs a long time ago--he even threatened me before I took him to court the last time).

								Florida, USA.<br/>
I am considering purchasing in cash a house in Orlando that is in process of being built. I would be paying for the house largely in cash from my personal funds. The contract that the building company wants me to sign includes a statement advising of the Florida Construction Lien. The building company refuses to include a release of lien in the contract, arguing that they rely on goodwill, and so will not default on their contractors. But they still refuse to provide a clause in the contract stating that upon termination of the building and final payment that the builder will supply a complete release of lien, and instead they only offer an affadavit on liens upon termination of the building, along with a ""clear title"". My questions are; (1) is this a normal situation in Florida building?, (2) is it safe to enter into this contract without a formal release of lien?, (3) what protection is available against liens in building contracts?

								Re: Release of construction lien, Florida<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that in the case of contracts, terms that are mentioned in the written agreement are enforceable. In this regard provisions relating to a release of lien must be stated so that your rights can be protected. If provisions are not mentioned relating to release then it may affect your financial interest in case of disputes. You may discuss with the contractor that contract provisions which are agreed must be mentioned in writing and therefore all the things including the release must be mentioned in the agreement. <br/>

I sent 3000$ for downpay for fixing house <br/>
The rest of money i will send it later<br/>
My husband called agent<br/>
How much do you charge for managing all fixing the house ?<br/>
she said she will charge us 1000$<br/>
I feel like it is overcharged <br/>
If she charged us like that why she didn't mention anything<br/>
She said for renting the house she will charge 25% of renting fee first month<br/>
From second month she will charge us 15% <br/>
I feel like she overcharge us everything<br/>
The agent she didn't anwer the phone well since we asked why she charge us a thousnad for managing the fixing the house<br/>

I wish to inform you that terms of contract determine rights and duties of parties. Terms of contract will include terms agreed between parties. In this oral as well as written contract are allowed. In this regard when managing fee is not informed to you then that does not form part of the contract. If real estate agent refuses to perform his part of duty without managing fee then you an claim your payment back from real estate agent on the ground that real estate agent has breached agreement by not performing his duty and demanding fees which was not in terms of contract. <br/>

The first two months passed and the work was not completed.  He pleaded that his circumstances changed and we came to an agreement to have the work done by February.<br/>
<br/>
This date has passed and I told him I no longer wanted him to do the work.  He consistently promised to appear and failed to do so, coming to work twice a month only.  I also made agreement with him to have a vanity built by him in exchanged for computer services I rendered for him.  In total my services amount to $750.<br/>
<br/>
He left a couple tools here and I see no hope in ever getting my vanity from him (after nine months he still has not started it).  I want to retain the tools to recoup my losses from this misadventure with him, can I legally do so in Ontario?<br/>
<br/>
I know I can sue him in small claims court but given he already has several other cases on going, I doubt if this will gain me anything.  I am wondering what my options are.  We do not have any contract, rather verbal agreements made with witnesses.<br/>
<br/>
thanks

								re: Contractor tools, Ontario -- I want to retain the tools to recoup my losses<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that you can sell tools of contractor only after informing contractor that you are doing such a thing. In this regard oral agreements are valid contract. Oral agreements are classified as oral contract. In this regard as other party has not performed services therefore you can make other person responsible for breach of contract. In this regard you may file a suit for recovery of money in small claims court. You may sell goods after giving a notice to the other person. <br/>

								Hello I am contacting you to attempt to get something done about the my living situation. I moved to this apartment on June 1st 2007. At that time I was aware of some maintenance issues as well as several holes in the parking lot but I was also assured that the issues were being taken care of. At this time not one repair has been made. And when I say holes in the parking lot I mean HUGE holes. Holes that if you run into with your car you are garaunteed to have a flat tire. I personally have had to replace two tires and a crank shaft on my car as well as a friend having to replace a tire last week. Further more pipes are leaking,it's getting cold and I have no heat(as well as several other tenants I have spoken with),sewage is backing up in my bathroom sink that is putting the same stinch inside the apartment that you smell outside at night;the distinctive smell of sewage. Of course I have reported all of these issues to the rent office. At the same time when I moved in I was assured the water was included in the $590.00 per month rent. After staying here for three months I noticed every month around the same time the water would be off. Then I found out that there had been a water leak and the water was actually off because the bill had not been paid for the complex. The next month I recieved a letter from the rent office stating they are going to start charging for water and I owed them $52. I certainly did not pay it and have no intentions of paying it. If nothing else should that not be grounds to terminate the lease without loosing my deposit? I found out today from a lady that works in the rent office that there is no maintenance man so what is the point of complaining when there is noone to make the repairs.I could go on and on. Please help

It is permitted to break the lease (or sue for the decreased lease value in small claims)  if they have failed to comply with the lease and/or there are material health, noise or safety concerns--but save all information, evidence etc. in case they dispute the situation and try to take you to small claims court.

<br/>
There is so much to say about this horrid slumlord (Hyoung Joon Park aka Leo)it is much easier to list my experience: 1. He signed a lease with me (family with small children)even though he currently had a lease with the current renters of 454 Carlton Ave. The day before we were to move I visited the rental and was shocked to see people living in it who had no idea they were moving. 2. The night before he meets with us and tells us the current renters would not relocate. Note: he was trying to force them to move even though they had a lease with them that did not expire for four months. 3. Our family was forced to move into one of his other properties (located in a junkyard)as we had no other place to go and had to be out of our old apartment. 4. The house was infected by bedbugs; all of us were covered with sores. 5. He came to spray the house and proceeded to spray all of our clothing, bedding and furniture with pesticide. He told me it was safe, later I found out it was toxic to humans and was a general pesticide. 6. After a month went by, I negotiated with the current tenets of the apartment and got them to agree to move - they were Lehigh students and felt bad for my family. 7. I paid $800 for professional movers, he refused to reimburse me but, insisted he would use his van to move my family of four  - I had no choice so I agreed. He damaged our items, took days to do it and some of our furniture is missing. 8. He told us the new place did not have bedbugs but, once my family moved in we got infested again. The previous renters later told us that in fact the house too was infested. I had to pay for the exterminator to come and spray. This is when we were told the white powder all over the house was severely toxic and was used for bedbugs in small cracks. My whole family had the powder all over them for days. 9. The heat was double of what he told us and at times has been broken for weeks. 10. Severe leaks were never fixed and sinks were shut off in the bathroom. 11. My son put his leg through the rotted front porch which Hyoung Joon Park promised to fix over a year ago. 12. He refused to give us a water bill for 1.5 years and then demanded 1100 within 48 hours. When asked to fix the leaks and take a $100 off for the wasted water pouring from the facets he told us to move. 13. He signed a contract promising to move us to our new home and as of this evening he is refusing to do so which leaves us with the bill once again. I have never met such a dishonest man in my life. He will lie to your face time and time again. He rents to Lehigh University Students which he takes advantage of constantly. There is nothing more to say....

I wish to inform you that you are not required to pay T-constructor. In this regard the work was not properly performed by T-constructor. In this there was a breach of contract done by T-constructor. As the contract was not performed by T-constructor therefore you have a right to terminate contract. You may argue that you had terminated contract of T-contractor because he had violated clause of contract by not performing work as per contract. If you have taken work from a person who does not have licence or is not ready to give evidence then the problem may be by other authorities for whom work was performed and not T-contractor who had broken contract.<br/>

								I hired a gentleman to do some finishing work for me needless to say it turned out to be a complete nightmare. He would disappear for weeks on end and his quality of work was on par with a weekend warrior handyman. Long story short he gave me a sob story that he needed to get the money I owed him to get his belongings out of a pawn shop. I told him that his work was not finished and he needed to fix alot of it before I paid him the full amount. He reassured me that he would finish the work up to regular standards and that he would bring me a receipt the next day for the money I would give him. I paid him $2000 of the $2700 I owed him feeling bad for his situation and him generally being a nice guy. Boy was that far from the case, he dissapeared leaving behind roughly $500.00 worth of his tools to take up my living room so I couldn't move in. I proceeded to call him and leave him messages for the next month and a half with no answer or call back. Then finally a subcontractor that was working for me told me that my missing handyman contacted him to warn him that I had not paid him for any work and to watch out. The sub told the man that he has seen the work (or lack of) that he had left and that he should contact me to tell me this information. The handyman then stated that he will be placing a lien against my home. I was surprised when I heard this considering I have not heard from him since I paid him $2000. So I tried to contact him again to no avail. Then today I received a call from my financial advisor stating that the handyman had a lawyer and the lawyer sent a letter to her confirming a contruction lien for the sum of $5000.00 for materials and work. I supplied all material and have receipts as proof. The dates that the letter stated he worked untill is at least one week after he disappeared. I contacted the lawyer and confirmed the lien and that my letter is in the mail. How can the handyman place a lien on my property when the work is not finished and the amount is completely falsefied? The contract was verbal with nothing placed in writing but I sure do have plenty of witnesses to the work performed and the stress my family was put through with this process. What would be my next steps and would this be a valid claim against me? Why on earth is it so easy in Ontario to place a lien on a home considering the lack of evidence? <br/>

								re: Construction Lien (handyman, subcontractor) -- Ontario, Canada<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that there is a contractor lien when work has been performed but payment has not been made. In your case, you have paid $2,000 to the contractor and he had not performed the work. In this regard, you may object to the contractor's lien on the ground that you had paid to the contractor who was hired by you and work is not completed. Even the sub contractor has not completed work. You may argue that as other party had caused breach of contract, therefore, they cannot now claim construction lien. Further as breach was done by other party you may claim damages from the other party. You may place before the court all evidence in support of the facts pleaded by you.<br/>

								Recently discovered severe water damage underneath the cedar siding of my 13 year old home.  Source is the roof flashing at the top of the chimney chase, as well as many of the windows.  So far we have uncovered about $15-20K in damage, including some structural framing.  <br/>
<br/>
We bought the home from an independent builder who had built it as a spec. home.  He had built one other home on the block that was already occupied.  Interior workmanship was excellent, no reason to believe there would be any construction issues.<br/>
<br/>
I am located in Wisconsin.  What is the statute of limitations on something like this?  Do we have any recourse to try to recover some or all of the cost of repairs?  The builder has since moved to Florida and is no longer in the business.<br/>
<br/>
Our insurance company has already denied our claim, which I expected since the damage occurred over such a long period of time and is not tied to any one natural disaster.

								Re: Flashing failures - chimney and windows<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that period of limitation in Wisconsin is 6 years in case of contracts. In this regard your action after 13 years may be barred by statue of limitation. An action regarding breach of contract may be brought only within the duration of statue of limitation. However, if the contractor has given a warranty and if the period of the warranty is still in force then you give a notice to the contractor and if the contractor fails to resolve the matter then you may file a lawsuit.<br/>

								Over the summer we contracted the services of a pool heater repair company, the service of cleaning and a tune-up of our Pool Heater. It was a prepaid service.<br/>
<br/>
The company was to make an appointment for the visit and to complete the service at that time. They did not call and instead just showed up and performed the service while I was not there. While cleaning the heater they deemed it necessary to replace a part which they indicated had irregular voltage (we did not have a problem previously with the heater). They then left an invoice for approximately $400.<br/>
<br/>
I refused to pay the invoice. Their only settlement option was that they are willing to send the technician back to remove the part and cancel the bill, however I am uncomforable having them reinstall the old part, as I will have no idea whether it is installed correctly, and believe they will just blame it on the ""faulty"" part.<br/>
<br/>
The document stated that they were to advise as to whether any additional services were required, however in speaking with the owner he indicated they simply perform the service if it is less than $500.00 and their clients simply always pay.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions as to what my rights are in this case? I am new to this site and would really appreciate any input you may have.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance,<br/>

								Re: Ontario, Canada - Pool Heater Contractor Additional Services Provided<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that you may be additionally liable only if such a service was ordered by you. In this regard the portion changed was a portion which was changed without informing you. You now have two options. First is either to pay price and retain new part or ask for changing new part and put your old part. In this regard you may claim that there was no requirement of change of portion other party must show that there was requirement of change of such a portion. If they now wish to remove their new part then they must provide the old part which was initially fixed and also compensation to you for damage which the instrument may suffer because of removing of part. As the portion was changed by other party therefore you may either pay the reasonable price for changed portion or may allow return of new part and fixing of old portion. In case you wish to have enjoyment of new part then you may be made liable for new part price.  Further in this regard you may file a complaint with Ontario Ministry of Consumer Services. <br/>

								We built a home on a golf course last year. We live in Missouri. The builder is the golf course owner. He and his family live on the course and also owns the clubhouse/restaurant on the course. He has build many homes on the course. He was general contractor and many of his subs were personal friends and long-time subs for him. We did not get lien waivers. This was the first (and last) home building experience for us.<br/>
<br/>
 Four months after completion of our home, we received a letter from the flooring/tile sub informing us that the $18,000 owed him had not been paid. He told us about the possibility of a lien being placed against our home if the builder did not live up to his obligation. His company had done much business with the builder in the past. As our home was being build, we paid the builder the amount he would request at each statge of construction. We paid so much up front and then we had 'draws' as they became necessary--all at the request of the builder. We had built up enough equity in our previous homes and the one we had recently sold, so we paid him with a check whenever he requested the 'draw'. We confronted the builder after we received the letter. He had his story that he owed money for a note that had to be paid off and various other excuses. It was our money and he used it for other bills, etc. We also knew that he had spent an expensive week of golfing with friends in Myrtle Beach (obviously with our money) a month or two after our home was completed. He promised to pay the flooring/tile sub and since has paid only about $4,000 or so on that debt. A month after we received the letter from this sub, we had a knock on our door. It was the gutter sub, and he said he had not been paid a penny of the $1700 the builder owed him. He was a personal friend of the builder and had done business with him for years. My wife and I again confronted our builder. He promised to contact this sub and pay him. We had asked the gutter sub to call us back when he was paid and he did a few days later. <br/>
<br/>
Our question is whether there is a statute of limitations or is it still possible for them to put a lien on our home? What other advice do you suggest? I have talked to the State's Attorney's Office twice, and they can really offer no advice except to talk to an attorney. <br/>
<br/>
Our other big concern is our road out in front of our home. We were promised (and all homes built here conform to this) that the road would be asphalted when we purchased the lot where our home was to be built. This was supposed to be done right after the heavy equipment was out of the area as our home was being built. We moved in last August (2009). His excuse last year was it was too wet although we had a lot of hot weather before the fall rains, then too cool last fall. This year it was too wet early and this summer he just has not gotten it done. He is now out of the homebuilding buisiness and concentrating on th golf course.It does not look like he wants to voluntarily live up to his obligations. I received an estimate last week of about $8,200 for the road. What recourses do I have with these issues?!?

								Have you ever considered the need for seeking legal advice before making a building contract with any builder? If your answer is no, there is a high chance for you to get in trap, so be careful and do consider the following things. You may not be able to recognize any possible trap in a building contract and you may feel that the contract is straight forward and clear. It always happen with clients who avoid legal advice since they are eager to save money that they interpret the contract by himself and seek to activate the termination provisions thereof. But the issue lies in the possibility that if the client does not get a legal advice on the matter, it may be for his own disadvantage and there is a chance for him to expose himself to a claim from the builder to seek orders against him at the Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal (CTTT) for repudiation of the contract and loss of profits. This kind of an issue could be avoided if the client had got legal advice as to how the contract should be interpreted from a competent practitioner. And it may happen that during the <a href=""http://www.effectiveconsultancy.com.au/"" target=""_blank"">cttt disputes</a> your likelihood for failure may be high. <br/>
<br/>
Usually legal representation is not allowed by CTTT. If the amount claimed is above $10,000,00 you are given the freedom to get legal representation and if the claim is made on this amount or less than it, the client is supposed to present before the tribunal by himself for the hearing. Also, there is another provision that for those who have had a claim made against them, or are thinking about making a claim against someone else in the CTTT, legal advice is essential before he does anything.

<br/>
I had water damage in my house that required quite a bit of work - removing kitchen cabinets, scraping our textured ceilings, painting walls in 4 rooms, etc.  We had a content removal company take out all of our items in the living room and kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
The construction firm did not keep us updated very well about how progress was going and what should have taken 7 days kept us in a hotel for 15 nights with me constantly having to ask them what was going on.  We were told at one point that our house would be finished on Friday and our property moved back in on Tuesday after a holiday on Monday.  My husband and I drove to our house on Saturday to see the progress to find that it clearly was not close to done.  Upon inspection, we also realized our refrigerator had been unplugged and all our food ruined.<br/>
<br/>
Due to it being an evening hour, I had two small children with us and basically nothing in the house, I took some pictures of the floor, of the food in bags and the empty fridge and cleaned everything up because it was filthy and stank.  I didn't want to leave it until the workmen came back three days later.  I called the owner of the company that night to let him know.  He apologized (after saying, ""the content removal company didn't take your fridge contents?"") but asked me to call the head of the work group and let him know.  I left him a message.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm having difficulty getting the company to pay for the food.  The individual who left it unplugged owned up to it to his boss right away.  I was told they were working on a resolution for him to have it taken out of his paycheck.   The next day the crew came back to finish up some things that weren't done correctly and the individual in question asked me how much was in the fridge and told me he had done it.  I told him it was probably about $200 worth of food and he seemed really uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
I hated having that conversation with him, my feeling is the company should pay me for the food and handle the money from the individual internally without putting me in the middle.  Regardless, nothing was said about it after that point.<br/>
<br/>
The insurance has paid the money to me for the work and I asked about the refrigerator contents again.  Now they want an itemized list so they can provide proof to the employee who is going to have to pay for it.  They know he did it, he admitted it so it isn't as though the action itself is in dispute.<br/>
<br/>
I have not paid them yet (we just received the disbursement from the insurance company) - can I withhold the money until there's a resolution with the food?  Can I just deduct $200 from our deductible of $500 if they don't resolve this soon?  I can give them an itemized list and the pictures of the food but I don't trust them at this point not to try to weasel out of the cost of the food.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really frustrated.  Could someone please tell me what my obligations are at this point and what theirs are and how I go about making sure they do the right thing?

								Hi<br/>
<br/>
I read a similar post on this forum but there was no conclusive answer.<br/>
<br/>
Before starting work on our home we agreed with the builder that 10% final payment would be held back until all work was completed and all parties were happy with the result.<br/>
He has now demanded this payment despite the sink not being installed (offered to let us hold back a small amount for this) and numerous other small issues like <br/>
damaged plaster, water streaming over the guttering in heavy rain, pull switch broken, window keys missing etc.<br/>
<br/>
As I said these are mainly small issues but ones I feel should be resolved before payment.  Am I within my rights to withhold this final payment?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.

								Re: Final payment demanded despite work not being finished<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that terms of your agreement with other party will govern your rights and duties. In this regard, if your agreement provides that final payment will be made after completion of all work then you may withhold payment till the time all work has not been properly performed. Although small work may be left but as work is not completed, therefore, you may withhold payment. However, under Article 10 of the Construction Act of 1996 you must serve a written notice giving out the reasons why the payment is being withheld. <br/>

								Georgia, USA<br/>
Earlier this year I had my home roof replaced that was paid in full shortly after the work was completed. The company I did business with had sub contracted the actual work. A couple months after the work was complete I received a letter that a Claim of Lien was filed against my home. Since then I have received a signed and dated Waver and Release of Lien from my original contractor and that I have paid in full for the work done. I wrote the law firm that sent the Claim of Lien asking to be formally removed from that claim but as yet have not received a response. I read that Georgia has laws regarding these things to ensure no one has to pay twice for work done. They say to have your contractor execute a waiver and release of all claims through the date of each pay application in addition to executing a lien waiver. What does all of this mean?<br/>
How can I ensure that I don't have a lien against my home?<br/>

								Re: Claim of Lien for roof replacement<br/>
<br/>
I want to inform you that under Georgia Code - Property - Title 44, Section 44-14-361.1(4), you have no personal liability as the owner of the property. Further, as you have already paid the complete amount as agreed to the contractor then no further payment needs to be made by you. However, you will need to provide evidence to the court of all the payments made by you. The court will consider all the facts and decide the matter.<br/>

I guess what confuses me is why the sub contracted company would go through the process of filing the Claim of Lien against my home instead of concentrating on the company that I contracted to do the work.

I don't know Georgia law, but here in Texas, if a contractor doesn't pay a sub-contractor, the sub-contractor can indeed insist on getting their money from the homeowner.

								Re: Claim of Lien for roof replacement<br/>

In my case I paid the contractor in full. The contractor without my knowledge sub-contracted the work and the sub-contractor put a claim of lien on my home. Why would Texas make a home owner responsible for that and cause the home owner to pay twice for work?

Unless one has a contract with a contractor specifying that the contractor himself or herself must to the work, the contractor can hire whoever they want to do the job.<br/>

A ""contractor,"" by definition, is somebody who contracts other people to do work for them.  They don't need the customer's permission to hire someone to do a job.  That's what distinguishes them from ""handymen"" who market their own services.<br/>
<br/>
Contractors hire two sorts of people, employees or sub-contractors.  Employees work directly for the employer for wages.  Sub-contractors own their own businesses and get paid by the job.<br/>
<br/>
If a person hires a contractor and pays them, but the contractor hires a sub-contractor to do the job and doesn't pay them, why is the customer liable to pay the sub-contractor?  Because the homeowner is the one who benefitted from the sub-contractor's work.<br/>
<br/>
In such a case, essentially the contractor stole from the homeowner.  That doesn't justify the homeowner stealing from the sub-contractor.<br/>
<br/>
The homeowner must pay the sub-contractor and then go after the contractor to get their money back.

								Re: Claim of Lien for roof replacement<br/>
<br/>
This is the real situation of which I feel happened to me and all the other ""defendants"". There must be, or at least should be, some kind of protection from this but probably not.<br/>
<br/>
The company I contracted with, Company A, had an A- Better Business Bureau accreditation when I contracted them. Company A sub contracted Company B to do the actual work. There was no mention in my contract that a Company B would be doing the work. The first I heard of Company B was when their lawyer sent me a claim of lien. Company B has no accreditation with the BBB. Had I know ahead of time that Company B was to do the work I would not have signed the contract but would have looked for a Company C that had top accreditation and did not subcontract, or, with my knowledge, subcontracted to a company with high accreditation.<br/>
<br/>
The problem then is this, because Company B was not BBB accredited and therefor would get very little if any work because of this, they look for contractors like Company A to secretly sub contract with and ask for no payment until the job is complete. Then if Company A does not pay Company B, Company B has their lawyer place a lien on the properties for which the work was done which includes interest and attorneys fees.Company B will eventually recover all their money plus interest and Company A walks away with a bundle. Company A's BBB accreditation drops from A- to F and subsequently goes out of business because it cannot operate with that kind of accreditation.<br/>
<br/>
The key here then is that the companies that will actually perform the work are not listed in the contract and obviously don't have to be. There should be consumer protection laws that cover this. Subcontractors should be listed in the contract or the contract should be null and void if work is subcontracted without the approval of the person(s) having the work done.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the BBB is a super organization of which I have the greatest respect and no one should assume in any way shape or form that I am faulting them. This statement is not about them, it's about the laws that should protect people from the deceit of companies like A &amp; B. The BBB is a tremendous credit and reference for all honest consumers.

								Georgia, USA<br/>
Earlier this year I had my home roof replaced that was paid in full shortly after the work was completed. The company I did business with had sub contracted the actual work. A couple months after the work was complete I received a letter that a Claim of Lien was filed against my home. Since then I have received a signed and dated Waver and Release of Lien from my original contractor and that I have paid in full for the work done. I wrote the law firm that sent the Claim of Lien asking to be formally removed from that claim but as yet have not received a response. I read that Georgia has laws regarding these things to ensure no one has to pay twice for work done. They say to have your contractor execute a waiver and release of all claims through the date of each pay application in addition to executing a lien waiver. What does all of this mean?<br/>
How can I ensure that I don't have a lien against my home?<br/>

								Re: Claim of Lien for roof replacement<br/>
<br/>
I want to inform you that under Georgia Code - Property - Title 44, Section 44-14-361.1(4), you have no personal liability as the owner of the property. Further, as you have already paid the complete amount as agreed to the contractor then no further payment needs to be made by you. However, you will need to provide evidence to the court of all the payments made by you. The court will consider all the facts and decide the matter.<br/>

I don't know Georgia law, but here in Texas, if a contractor doesn't pay a sub-contractor, the sub-contractor can indeed insist on getting their money from the homeowner.

In my case I paid the contractor in full. The contractor without my knowledge sub-contracted the work and the sub-contractor put a claim of lien on my home. Why would Texas make a home owner responsible for that and cause the home owner to pay twice for work?

NEXT DAY, THE BUILDER SENT OUT SOME GUYS I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND THEY HAD TO PULL BACK THE CARPET HALFWAY AND THEY SUCKED UP 15 GALLONS OF WATER FROM THE CARPET, FLOOR AND PADDING.  AFTER TELLING THE MEN THAT I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE PADDING BEING WET AND THE POSSIBILITY OF MOLD GROWING, THEY EVENTUALLY PUT SOME NEW PADDING DOWN. AFTER WEEKS OF BEING DODGE BY THE BUILDER, HE SENDS HIS NEW SUPERVISOR, HIS SON, TO OUR HOME AND HE TELLS US THAT IT WAS THE 100 YEAR FLOOD AND OF COURSE WATER WILL GET IN. I WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THAT ANSWER.

Okay, first you need to prioritize.<br/>
<br/>
What is the number one priority?  Getting your house in order.<br/>
<br/>
If you are moderately healthy and fit, here's a suggested course of action.<br/>
<br/>
You are correct in assuming that the pad, once wet, will get moldy.  Water remediation people never leave the pad.  The carpet has a latex backing.  Once soaked, the integrity of the latex is broken and the carpet is trash.<br/>
<br/>
Get the carpet and pad out of there.  Get a utility knife and slice the carpet into strips a couple feet wide and roll 'em up and take them outside.  Toss the pad, too.<br/>
<br/>
The carpet and pad will wick up moisture and transfer it to the base trim and drywall.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't worry that you will have some expense to replace the carpet later; walking on bare concrete for a while won't kill you.  The expense of carpet replacement will pale in comparison to mold remediation, if it gets that far. <br/>
<br/>
Get some fans in there and circulate the air.<br/>
<br/>
If you have to get a sump pump in there, buy one and get it going.<br/>
<br/>
Go outside and study the situation.  If the lot is sloped to the house, you need to get the water to drain away from the house.  Unless the house is in a pit, there has to be somewhere for the water to drain to. Locate the nearest spot that is lower than the house.  Get a pickaxe and shovel and dig a shallow trench from the low spot of your choice around to the uphill side of the house.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't have to be a deep trench, even a few inches deep will work, just enough to intercept any water flowing toward the house and direct it around the house to the downhill side.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have that under control, then move on to dealing with the builder.

								My fiance and i back in November 2009 found a company in North Carolina to build us a house in Columbia South Carolina area. They said they have done a few homes in South Carolina and it would not be an issue. They are an independent company that sells Palm Harbor homes. I am not on the contract, only my fiance due to my bankruptcy ayear ago. We have had many issues but some of the big ones are :<br/>
They foraged her signature on the land documents and spelled it wrong <br/>
They cleared out the land poorly and plowed the trees onto a separate lot leaving a tunnel going several hundred feet through our tree coverage. <br/>
They put the house where we told them we didnt want it. <br/>
They put the water pipes where we told them we didnt want it. <br/>
They said it would take 3-4 weeks after the construction close but it has been almost 3 months and we are about to lose the 8,000 tax credit. <br/>
They were very generic on the contract. They said that the clearing and grading of the land, the seed and straw and the driveway were ""landscaping'' the garage with concrete slab, electricity ramp and stairs were ""building behind house"" and so on, but required me to pay for the driveway saying it was not in the contract. and are trying to charge us for the stairs and ramp to the garage stating it was not in the contract. they decided not to use a concrete slab in the garage stating it was not in the contract. We have emails with them saying they would do these things and then emails stating they changed their minds. <br/>
This ordeal has cost us 2,000+ in extra interest fees for the construction loan, 800 for having our stuff moved into temporary storage due to not being able to move it in the house, 200+ a week for animal boarding since April 30th when they verbally said we should be done, then stopped all work for 3 weeks. and 8,000 tax credit which we wont be able to get now even though we were in contract mid december and construction close 3/25. They had the permits incorrect and we had to wait to get the electricity set up.<br/>
<br/>
They told us if we get a lawyer, due to arbitration agreement they will hold things up 6 months and we wont be able to move in until after its settled.<br/>
<br/>
One lawyer told me to schedule a meeting with them as soon as we close and move in.<br/>
Another told me one of 2 things will happen, we will spend 1,500-2000 on lawyer fees to win back maybe 3,000 at most for what we had to pay due to because of their neglect. or they will hold things up until we rack up more lawyer fees than we can afford (ie. 20,000) and when we cant do anymore, they will sue us for their lawyer fees.<br/>
<br/>
What can/should we do.<br/>
Will it even be worth it?<br/>
What about punitive damages?

								Re: Manufactured Home Builder Company Wrongdoings<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that the acts of the contractor show breach of contract. In this case, you may file a suit and can claim compensation for losses suffered by you. Loss at present will be the amount which you have to spend because of the wrong doing of the contractor. Further, if the parties have agreed to arbitration in a contract then the matter will have to be filed for arbitration. If you desire to reduce your legal cost then you may represent yourself in the matter.<br/>

Okay, you have to decide on what you ultimately want.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to spend a lot of time and money on legal fees to win a case and get a judgement that you will likely never receive?<br/>
<br/>
Or do you want to get your house/land in the condition that you want it?<br/>
<br/>
You have to pick your battles.<br/>
<br/>
If you want the satisfaction of having a court tell you that you were right, go down that expensive road.<br/>
<br/>
Or, spend the money fix up the place the way you want it and consider your experience a lesson learned.

I am not on the contract, only my fiance due to my bankruptcy ayear ago. We have had many issues but some of the big ones are :<br/>
They foraged her signature on the land documents and spelled it wrong <br/>
They cleared out the land poorly and plowed the trees onto a separate lot leaving a tunnel going several hundred feet through our tree coverage. <br/>
They put the house where we told them we didnt want it. <br/>
They put the water pipes where we told them we didnt want it. <br/>
They said it would take 3-4 weeks after the construction close but it has been almost 3 months and we are about to lose the 8,000 tax credit. <br/>
They were very generic on the contract. They said that the clearing and grading of the land, the seed and straw and the driveway were ""landscaping'' the garage with concrete slab, electricity ramp and stairs were ""building behind house"" and so on, but required me to pay for the driveway saying it was not in the contract. and are trying to charge us for the stairs and ramp to the garage stating it was not in the contract. they decided not to use a concrete slab in the garage stating it was not in the contract. We have emails with them saying they would do these things and then emails stating they changed their minds. <br/>
This ordeal has cost us 2,000+ in extra interest fees for the construction loan, 800 for having our stuff moved into temporary storage due to not being able to move it in the house, 200+ a week for animal boarding since April 30th when they verbally said we should be done, then stopped all work for 3 weeks. and 8,000 tax credit which we wont be able to get now even though we were in contract mid december and construction close 3/25. They had the permits incorrect and we had to wait to get the electricity set up.<br/>
<br/>
They told us if we get a lawyer, due to arbitration agreement they will hold things up 6 months and we wont be able to move in until after its settled.<br/>
<br/>
One lawyer told me to schedule a meeting with them as soon as we close and move in.<br/>
Another told me one of 2 things will happen, we will spend 1,500-2000 on lawyer fees to win back maybe 3,000 at most for what we had to pay due to because of their neglect. or they will hold things up until we rack up more lawyer fees than we can afford (ie. 20,000) and when we cant do anymore, they will sue us for their lawyer fees.<br/>
<br/>
What can/should we do.<br/>
Will it even be worth it?<br/>
What about punitive damages?

								Re: Manufactured Home Builder Company Wrongdoings<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that the acts of the contractor show breach of contract. In this case, you may file a suit and can claim compensation for losses suffered by you. Loss at present will be the amount which you have to spend because of the wrong doing of the contractor. Further, if the parties have agreed to arbitration in a contract then the matter will have to be filed for arbitration. If you desire to reduce your legal cost then you may represent yourself in the matter.<br/>

								Re: Manufactured Home Builder Company Wrongdoings<br/>
<br/>
Okay, you have to decide on what you ultimately want.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to spend a lot of time and money on legal fees to win a case and get a judgement that you will likely never receive?<br/>
<br/>
Or do you want to get your house/land in the condition that you want it?<br/>
<br/>
You have to pick your battles.<br/>
<br/>
If you want the satisfaction of having a court tell you that you were right, go down that expensive road.<br/>
<br/>
Or, spend the money fix up the place the way you want it and consider your experience a lesson learned.

								Hello, my situation is as followed. Im curently usure wether I owe money. I had an old house reformed a few years back and during the reformation we asked the builders to stop their work as we couldnt pay the last sum of money. They stopped their work and left. Four years down the line they are now asking us for the last sum although the work was not completed. Above all there is no contract. Where do I stand?

<br/>
I wish to inform you that you can inform the builder that about four years ago it had been intimated to the builder by you that the work was to be stopped as you were not in a position to make any further payment. Accordingly, the builder had stopped the work and left. In every state there is a statute of limitations. You can check the statute of limitations for your state. If the period elapsed between the builder leaving the work and now is more than the period of the statute of limitations, you can inform the builder you are not liable. Alternatively, you can inform the builder that as the work was stopped 4 years ago on the condition that no further payment was to be made now you are not liable to make any further payment.<br/>

Okay, if the contractor is coming after you for money from a job from 4 years ago, that means the contractor is desperate for cash.<br/>
<br/>
If the contractor is desperate for cash, then he probably can't afford to take you to court.<br/>
<br/>
If there is no contract, then they have nothing they could show a court to back up their claim that you owe them money, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Tell the contractor, in writing, something along the lines of, ""We both know that I owe you nothing.  I will take legal action if you continue to harass me.""

								we had a septic smell coming from our yard where our septic system is. A neighbor complained so the county health dept came to our house and did a test where they flushed a dye down the drain.After the complaint we stopped doing laundry in our home and the smell has ceased. 8 days later the health dept still comes every day looking for a leak,they originally said the test would take 3 days.<br/>
<br/>
If there is no smell present and no dye present how long do they have the right to enter our property?<br/>

Can I ask them for documentation to enter our property? or should we just wait it out?<br/>

								Hi, I bought a house in sarnia, ontario, and the backyard was pretty much destroyed. I required some dirt to fill it. I contacted a contractor for an estimate, and he quoted me 15-20 yards of dirt for 400. I told him I would have to wait, didnt have the spare money. He approached me a month later and said that he wanted to get rid of the dirt, I needed it, lets make a deal. He said 50 a month, 400. I said no problem, I can handle that. He starts dropping dirt in my backyard, and me assuming I'm still within my $400 and 15-20 yards said I would like some over here and over there in my yard. He says no problem, and drops off another 5 loads. He gives me an invoice for 900+ tax and says he wants 100 every two weeks. I explained that he quoted me 400 and I never agreed to anything over that, and that he was altering the payment agreement without my consultation. He asked me to come to an agreement 650 meet him halfway, I said no, and pick up your extra dirt, I'm not paying for it. He stated that he would charge me 400 to pick it up. I refused to pay it. He has left the dirt, stated that he doesnt want to pick it up as It is going to cost him money. He's still trying to negotiate a deal, and I refuse to negotiate as he has broken our verbal agreement, and never discussed a price increase with me. I have signed nothing. He has since threatened to contact his lawyer to collect the money. Am I wrong in assuming he has no ground to stand on, being as I signed nothing, he broke his agreement, he never informed me I had received all the dirt I had ordered, and that any more would cost extra? If he had of, at that point, I would have told him I would work with the 400. Can someone please explain if I have anything to be concerned about. He has also damaged property of mine, and left it a mess, my backyard is in worse condition now than it was before, and I have big piles of dirt sitting there, that I dont know if I should touch. He refuses to come pick it up, and I dont want it. Any help would be greatly appreciated<br/>

								Re: Contractor threatening to sue over my refusal to pay for extra services<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that if the contractor has dropped the extra dirt on your request then in this regard there exists a quasi contract between you and your contractor. However, in this you will be required to pay your contractor at the rate as agreed to initially. For the extra work done you will have to pay proportionately. If you have taken say 10% extra work then compensation to be paid to contractor will also increase by 10%. However, you can ask for compensation for any damages caused to your property.<br/>

You only discussed the $400 and that's it...<br/>

If he took it upon himself to dump more, that's his problem.  Pay him the $400 on the agreed-upon schedule and tell him to take a long walk off a short pier on the rest.<br/>

He has better things to do than chase you through the legal system for $500 and will go away.

We had some electrical repairs done prior to selling our house. <br/>

They were completed by a licensed electrician as stated in the P and S. <br/>
<br/>
Over 2 years later, buyer is trying to sue us ( in small claims court ) claiming the repairs were not up to code ( per electric co ). The power went out ( during a huge snow storm I might add ), pipes froze, etc. Also, this is a second home left unoccupied for 3 months, with the water left on. <br/>
<br/>
Do they have any recourse ? This is paragragh 13 of the P and S. <br/>

I wish to inform you that you can inform the buyer that the clause clearly provides that you were responsible before transferring house to buyer and you had performed all the duties of seller and now under the clause you cannot be made liable. Further, during the period of two years the buyer has not raised any objections regarding electrical repairs being not performed. This shows that all the electrical repairs were performed as per contract. Further, you may argue that all electrical repairs were carried out by licensed electrician and not raising any objections by buyer to electrician's quality of work at the time of purchase shows that you have performed your obligations. <br/>

								We live in an area of California where yards are divided by fences deemed community property. A few weeks ago, our neighbor told us he was painting the fence on his side &amp; was going to replace 2 posts the next day. Without our consent, the contractor poured cement in much wider holes in our yard and trashed our lawn. We spoke to our neighbors &amp; the foreman who agreed to make changes. Instead, the workers simply put back the fence with the bottom slats missing and several pieces of wood damaged on our side of the fence. They also busted our sprinkler pipe. A friend of ours is a landscape architect. He said most of the fence couldn't be fixed &amp; advised us to replace it, redo the cement &amp; re-sod the grass. <br/>
<br/>
Before we made any repairs to our property and the fence, we checked our CC&amp;Rs &amp; spoke to the HOA about the situation. They said it was completely between us and the people with whom we share the fence. According to our neighbors, they did not know the contractors were going to make any changes to our property and were not going to repair any of the damage caused. They were under the impression that the contractor was going to fix the cement as we all had discussed and put back the fence the way it was before the workers took it apart. So the neighbors aren't going to pay for any of thy repairs. We suggested they contact the company for reimbursement but they don't want the hassle. <br/>
<br/>
Since the contractor did not have permission from us to do what they did on our property and our side of the fence and lied about fixing the situation, can we can file a legal claim against the company?

								Re: Contruction Noise Protection?<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that generally the local codes specify the noise level which is permitted and in case if the noise level is above the permitted range then you can take legal action. In this you can file a suit against the university that they should take measures to reduce sound. In this you can also file an action for Tort of Nuisance because of sound levels created by construction activity. You can also file a complaint at local municipality that the university is not following laws relating to noise.<br/>

If your guy is a member of a trade organization, perhaps that group has some sort of disciplinary proceeding that penalizes members for work that is not considered up to its basic standards of workmanship.<br/>
If so, you might take action at that point. Also, if the state agency that licenses contractors has a relief fund, you might be able to plead your case there. However, if the guy you hired was not licensed, then you'd be out of luck.

								Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I live in Ontario and am having a problem with a contractor.  We hired someone to fix our garage door a month ago, which they did.  The first visit was a consultation for which they presented an invoice with no amount (which I asked about but got no response) after verbally telling me it would be less than $300 of repair the door. I signed it and was given a copy,  and he returned the next day to repair the door.  Upon completion I was presented an invoice for $250 which I signed and handed him a cheque (I have a copy).  The company cashed the cheque on Feb 10th.<br/>
<br/>
Today I received an invoice (different form than the others) claiming the technician had made an error in calculating the amount of labour and we still owe $180.  This invoice also has legal speak about paying their lawyers fees and how they owe the equipment until paid in full etc.<br/>
<br/>
I find this a bit smelly and feel like I am being scammed.  Isn't the error the technician's fault? Shouldn't he pay? (as unkind as that is, he is a nice guy)<br/>
<br/>
I do not think I should pay but would appreciate some advice.<br/>

Frank.

								I am trying to get a contractor to replace the roof on my house. I found a reputed construction company in my area who has been in business for several decades. Their contract looks pretty much standard, however I am somewhat concerned about one paragraph/clause in it that mentions creating a lien on my house. <br/>
<br/>
""This contract creates a mortgage or lien against your property to secure payment and may cause a loss of your property if you fail to pay the amount agreed upon. You have the right to consult an attorney. You have the right to rescind this contract within 3 business days after the date you sign it by notifying the contractor in writing that you are rescinding the contract""<br/>
<br/>
My questions is if this is normal/customary for such a contract or is this something I should be worried about? Do construction contracts typically have such clauses? I think that they law protects the contractor with mechanics lien in case of a default. <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate all responses. Thanks.

								Re: question about contract for roof replacement - lien on house<br/>
<br/>
Yep, standard operating procedure. Since you receive the insurance check, less your deductible, the roofing contractor has to rely on you to make payment to them. That is why they have that clause in there.

								[Took care of a land for 30 years!!!!]<br/>
<br/>
Hello everyone, <br/>
<br/>
Contacting you from Brussels with the following case: <br/>
<br/>
Our doctor is living at the ground floor of a building and has been taking care of the patch of ground in front of his house that goes up to the street for the past 30 years. He was thinking he was the owner of it.<br/>
<br/>
This year, the town of Brussels decided to make a roundabout just in front of his house and would have to pass on the ground he so fondly took care of because they say it's not his (and apparently they proved it).<br/>
<br/>
Well.. he's thinking of asking compensation for the following things:<br/>
<br/>
1. for all the work he did himself on that patch of ground throughout the years.<br/>
2. for the bills he paid a gardening company that redid the fence after someone crashed into it (he knows that person but he never came to give compensation)<br/>
3. for the money he paid after a rainstorm that destroyed the patch of land (the town of Brussels didn't intervene even though he called them).<br/>
<br/>
He also took care of that land because in a co-owners paper it's written that the person living at ground level must take care of garden in front of the building. So he was induced into error!<br/>
<br/>
Now are these demands worth it? Can he obtain anything at all seeing he is not the righfull owner of that land... but he invested so much in it!!!<br/>
<br/>
Eager to hear your suggestions!
							
						</div>, <div class=""js-post__content-text restore h-wordwrap"" itemprop=""text"">
							
								
								re: Person who took care of the land is not the owner (City of Brussels)<br/>
<br/>
I wish to inform you that in Brussels when it has been proved that the person is not the owner then his claim gets affected to some limit. In this the claim to have compensation basically depends as to who made the misrepresentation to doctor that he was the owner. If the city of Brussels was in any way involved then a claim for compensation can be made but if this mistaken belief City of Brussels has not been involved then they cannot be made liable for amount spent on land. However doctor may claim amount for his expenses spent on the person who has sold and who has made false representation to the doctor. This mainly involves as to who has made wrong representation to doctor.<br/>

								I live in Wisconsin.  I just started to enter into a contract to build a home.  The builders salesman has mislead us by telling us that we would get upgrades as a result of building a ""Parade Home"".  No work has started on the home as the load limits are on the road and no heavy equipment can move.<br/>
<br/>
Every time we want something upgraded he asks for a change order.  I was lead to believe that we would not own the home until the home was finished.  They asked me to do a bridge loan and I signed some papers that I thought were just the agreement to do the bridge loan and some warranty items.<br/>
<br/>
2 hours after I signed the papers I got home and saw some items I didnt like in the contract.  I immediately contacted the salesman who was there when I signed them and told him to get a hold of the owner asap and tell him I dont agree with the terms.<br/>
<br/>
I put down $3,000 and at this point want to get out of the contract.<br/>
<br/>
Do I have any recourse to get my 3,000 back and get out of the contract.  I dont think they have spent any money on anything yet.

The builders salesman has mislead us by telling us that we would get upgrades as a result of building a ""Parade Home"".  No work has started on the home as the load limits are on the road and no heavy equipment can move.<br/>
<br/>
Every time we want something upgraded he asks for a change order.  I was lead to believe that we would not own the home until the home was finished.  They asked me to do a bridge loan and I signed some papers that I thought were just the agreement to do the bridge loan and some warranty items.<br/>
<br/>
2 hours after I signed the papers I got home and saw some items I didnt like in the contract.  I immediately contacted the salesman who was there when I signed them and told him to get a hold of the owner asap and tell him I dont agree with the terms.<br/>
<br/>
I put down $3,000 and at this point want to get out of the contract.<br/>
<br/>
Do I have any recourse to get my 3,000 back and get out of the contract.  I dont think they have spent any money on anything yet.

								Re: Building a home - Builder misleading and just saw terms in contract I dont like.<br/>
<br/>
You can argue that you have not been satisfied. <br/>
<br/>
Their damages should be limited so they would normally hve to refund you most of the fees in any case if you cancel.

								We recently moved from an apartment in NYC. The apt has a porch with a drain. In May there was a bad storm with pouring rain and debris, no one  was home that weekend. Upon our return we discovered minor water damage inside the apt and immediately informed our landlord so as not to be  charged as we feel it was not our fault. We suspect that the drain could  not handle the amount of rain, and overflowed, or perhaps debris clogged  it. Note that instead of bars surrounding the porch there is a solid wall so the drain is the only way water can escape. There were no doors or windows open to allow water in.<br/>
<br/>
The landlord is now charging us for the damage via our security deposit and says it is our fault because we should have better cleaned the drain. He said it is the same if we hadn\'t cleaned the bathtub drain and water overflowed, which I do not agree with. What do you think? Are we  responsible?
							
						</div>, <div class=""js-post__content-text restore h-wordwrap"" itemprop=""text"">
							
								
								If it was caused by a storm or other outside force you generally are not responsible. If you left it clogged and full he may have some claim as you were responsible for the area within your control--as opposed to the outside roof, yard etc.<br/>
<br/>
You will want to emphasize that all was fine until the storm.

As per you have described the situation you are not responsible for that.But Landlord can claim for the damages because the premises are possessed by you.You should talk to your landlord and try to convince him .Though if he charges minor then it's OK! otherwise you should go to take legal action against him..

								Our neighbors 70 ft x 6 ft high retaining wall with attached chain link fence collapsed onto our property a month ago.  The owners have received 6 estimates that we know about because we see the contractors on their side of the yard.  Other than that nothing has been done to clean up the debris which is considerable.  They are avoiding talking to us and unless we happen to catch them outside there is no exchange of information.  We made it clear we would work with them if they would just let us know what is going on but it doesn't help.  Phone calls go unanswered or they hang up on us.  We get attitude and lies about stupid things....ie, has the insurance company contacted them?  After that we called their insurance company and they verified there is no coverage for this problem.  We want to avoid court if possible.  What can we legally do to put the pressure on them to clean up their mess?

Based on what you say here, you could file suit against them (or at least threaten to do so) in small claims court or in regular court; filing in small claims court is easier and requires no attorney...you could try to collect all of the costs and damages that you suffered due to their behavior... <br/>

His drainage system is insufficient and he has flooded our property every time it rains for over 2 years.   We hired a hydrologist who determined that their is water running under our foundation and that our house has a 99% chance of sustaining structural damage.   The builder denies it is his fault (even though we have pictures of the water running off his property).    We are sick of dealing with it and want him to buy our house so we can move out.   We have been told we might lose in court because their is no physical evidence of the damage under our house.   Can you force someone to pay for damage that cannot be seen or the potential damage that will be caused over time?

								My wife and I recently started a project to remodel a room that (we learned after the fact) was once a sun-room converted to a bedroom.  So that I'm clear, I completed all the demolition work, and we had quotes provided for drywalling and additional finish work.<br/>
<br/>
Long story short, we accepted a quote and provided a deposit.  Unfortunately, prior to the contractor beginning any work, we realized that additional work would be required prior to any finish work.  Specifically we wanted to purchase new windows, which would require new framing to the interior walls.  It's a long story...<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, we contacted the contractor immediately and asked him NOT to purchase any materials and that we would be placing the project on hold.  The contractor admitted that he had already cashed the check (no surprise) but had not yet purchased any of the supplies (this was literally a next day call from original signing and deposit provided).  In addition to asking the contractor to place our project on hold I made it very clear that I was no longer interested in the trim work as quoted, specifically due to the lack of options he could provide (he kind of rushed us into a decision on the trim).  But again, seeing that we called him next day after signing it was impossible for him to place an order and we wanted to skip the trim work altogether.  Quite simply, we wanted to the project on hold and he agreed NOT to purchase any materials or continue with scheduling until he heard back from us.<br/>
<br/>
I received a call today from the contractor asking for an update, and specifically when he could continue the work.  I explained that we are not yet ready to continue as we don't have replacement windows purchased, as well as the new framing work complete.  I mentioned that in addition to the additional postponing of the project we may have to cancel the project as other things have come up.  He immediately mentioned that he already purchased all the supplies, including the trim, and said that he was ready to complete now.  When I pressed about the trim he said he didn't remember me saying anything to the like of not wanting the trim.  Additionally, he attempted to warn me that any attempt to cancel the project would result in forfeiture of the deposit.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I KNOW he did not mention anything like this to me when we signed the contract.  Additionally, I reviewed my signed copy of the quote and it does NOT mention anything about a deposit being forfeited.<br/>
<br/>
With all that said, I spent a few minutes searching Wisconsin law (well .. a somewhat feeble attempt at searching) and I cannot find anything that says I would forfeit any deposit...<br/>
<br/>
At this point, my wife and I don't want to deal with this contractor at all and I'm completely opposed to turning the other cheek and losing my deposit.  We truly do need the funds for items that are taking precedence, so I plan to ask for a complete refund.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any advice on this?

								I own property in Oklahoma, my property line ends at the sidewalk and the city owns from the sidewalk to the center of the street. A driveway was installed by the homeowner 70 years ago to give access from the surface street to my adjacent property acrossed the unimproved section of ""city property"". I assume some type of access easement was granted by the city for homeowners to build driveways (not everyone on the street has cement). This section of my driveway beared the name of a now famous person's signuture that was removed by the ""famous person"" without my permission or the city's and filled back in with dry cement. My question is who owns the improvement (driveway).

Without knowing the full details and reviewing the documents it is impossible to say.  However, based on what you have shared here my best guess would be that you own it.  The easement should have passed when you purchased the property.  It sounds like you really need a lawyer to get to the bottom of this.  You might get a referral by going to the WLD main page for a lawyer in your area.  Hope it gets resolved properly.  AJJ

And since you can't put a septic on the property you do own because of proximity to a river the county permitted the installation. No easement was filed to allow for the septic installation on adjacent property. Is that legal or is the county breaking its own laws. What about resale of the property or adjacent property down the road?

								TN I purchased a new home 5 years ago and have had major issues with foundation cracking. I had to have $8500 worth of work done last year and the issues with severe cracking doors not locking and closing came back within 2 months. I have been told that my house was built where an existing home stood that had a huge basement and that no matter how much work I have put in this will not correct issue that I just need to tear the home down. What are my rights as a homeowner in TN. My home passed all inspections including FHA.

You certainly can still try to sue. That is a major defect and a material defect. There are many different ways to sue for that.

								TN - Construction of a second home was begun in April 2008 with a contractor from GA. The project is currently 90% completed.  On April 15, 2009 the contractor informed me he was having cashflow problems that he was working to resolve and would call me the following week with and update.  It is known that no one from the construction supervisor and no one from the company has been on the build site since the beginning of March.  At what point can the primary contractor be removed due to abandonment of the project?  Additionally the contractor received monies for assembly of a garage on the same property on the basis of an invoice not in the original contract. Would the handling of disputes of for that be covered under the arbitration requirement in the original contract or handled seperately in other civil or criminal (fraud) proceedings?  Builder has not replied to any inquiries fax, email, voicemail, or certified letters since April 15.

								My house was built in the Fall of 2003. I had dimensional asphalt shingles put on, which are rated for 80mph winds. This past Friday, we had wind gusts of between 40-50mph, and I had about a 10'x10' section of shingles blown off my house.<br/>
<br/>
I had a roofer (who subcontracts for my original builder) come out and look at the damage. I asked him why the shingles failed, and with one glance at a shingle that had fallen off, he was able to tell me. Apparently the original roofer who put the shingles on my house didn't nail them down in the proper position. Instead of going through the overlapping part of the shingle, the nails were driven behind that overlapped section through only 1 layer. This voids the warranty on my shingles - I have confirmed this fact with the shingle manufacturer. Also, more than likely this happened everywhere on my roof.<br/>
<br/>
The roofer who told me this didn't work for my builder at the time my house was built, but now he depends on the business from that builder, so he doesn't want to get in the middle of any dispute. The builder already told this roofer that I would be responsible for the cost of any work that needs to be done, since my home is outside of my original 1-year limited warranty (which included provisions for poor workmanship). In fact, the builder was quite angry with the roofer that he told me exactly why my shingles failed.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't personally talked to my builder since I found all this out, because I'm weighing all the different options I have in front of me. I'd like to think that he should be at least partially responsible for what happened. Even though I'm outside of my home's warranty, their faulty construction and lack of job-site supervision is costing me a lot of money on something that should last for the next 20 years. Their mistake voided the warranty on my shingles, so now I'm left to bear the entire cost of replacement.<br/>
<br/>
Do I have any legal recourse in this situation? Is it worth talking to a local attorney, or am I completely out of luck?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any opinions you can give.

Based on what you say here, you could file suit against them (or at least threaten to do so) in small claims court or in regular court; filing in small claims court is easier and requires no attorney...you could try to collect all of the costs and damages that you suffered due to their behavior... You may also report them to your state attorney general's office.

There is only one solution.   After over 30 years as an insurance agent I have seen contractors put on inferior roofs because there is no law requiring them to put on at least a twenty year warranteed shingle or roof.  Most contractors are only held responsible for one year therefore not much can be done today.<br/>
<br/>
Write your contressmen, senators and representatives in the state and U.S. to demand laws that won't let less than a twenty year warrantied shingle to be sold in the U.S.<br/>

Your builder will be held accountable in court because the roofer was negligent and since your builder was his employer at that point in time he is responsible for the actions of his employees. You can sue the builder I think.

								Hello,<br/>
<br/>
  Ontario Canada. A small company with a small parking lot (approx. 10 car parking capacity) routinely has someone blow dirt and dust from their parking lot, using a noisy gas powered leaf blower. This company is located in a residential area, and is surrounded by residential homes. <br/>
<br/>
  The dust clouds float right into my windows and covers everything in my house. I am disabled and fix computers for nonprofit. I have several PCs open (no walls on the PC chassis), and the components inside of the computers are covered with dust due to the dirt cloud kicked up by the leaf blower. There are absolutely no leafs on the parking lot in question. <br/>
<br/>
  I'm assuming leaf blowing <b>IS</b> legal and 3 hours of dirt blowing is not. 'Assuming' and 'Knowing' are 2 different things. Is it legal for the company in question to use the dirt blower, and is there anything we (myself and surrounding residents) can do to legally have this dirt blowing stopped. <br/>
<br/>
 If necessary, we can take time stamped video showing no leaves, a huge cloud of dirt and the time stamp will show the length of time this person is using blower in parking lot.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
<br/>

								When I had to take my builder to court the first time, during my research I discovered that only about half of the final inspections were ever done (approved by the city inspector) on my new house.  Problems continue to surface and I am running out of time (or have already run out of time) on a lot of the components covered under California Code.  I am worried that things will continue to surface and I might be stuck with a home that was not built to code.  I brought that up in my first case and the judge never said anything about it.<br/>
<br/>
THE QUESTION:  Isn't there a law that says a house must be built to code (with corresponding inspections) or the buyer gets a refund?  Is there something that I can do about it before my house falls down?

								We have just recently hired and built with a general contractor.<br/>
The house is almost complete, and the contractor wants payment.<br/>
There are many things wrong with our house, the siding needs to be redone, there are cracks in the ceilings, doors that will not open properly bacause they are not hung correctly, floor joist hangers that need to be installed, cut up heating ducts that are ruined because the contractor had to cut them to modify other things around them, a broken drain, backwards taps, I could go on and on. The big thing for me is the siding, we have had many written quotes for just under $10,000.00. Our contractor has always treated us like we are nothing, they are very disrespectful and hard to reason with. They have just told us that if they do receive full payment by tomorrow that they will be(not putting a lien on the house) but sueing us!!! We have our 10% holdback still but I need to know whether we have to pay them anything until all work is complete???? Do they have grounds to sue us??? They haven't even completed all work...<br/>

								Can an individual broker who is a general manager of the company put a mechanic\'s lien on our primary property because we did not pursue with his construction loan? I was surprised he was able to do so thru County Recorder office in Los Angeles, he claimed that he was our project manager of our property thus was able to get the mechanic\'s lien on us. until now since March 3, 2008, we did not recieve any court summons from him, I know that he has until 90 days to file a case against us, and if he does not do it, I was told that I can demand for the release of the mechanic\'s lien on our property. but the question is: can he re-apply for another  mechanic\'s lien on our property again after I had demanded to have the lien release after the 90 days period? He puts the mechanic\'s lien on our property because he wants me to pay him for his time in securing a construction loan which did not happen because his loan applications interest rate APR is 24% and he did not stand behind his word when he told me before it started that he will get me a construction loan then immediately convert it to permanent loan once the construction is finish in order to avoid double charges, later on, he said that I have to go to escrow twice; one for the construction loan and another for the permanent loan in which he charges 1% on each escrow transaction of the total loan amount. He wanted me to pay him $7,000+ for his 62 hours of work at $150/hour rate or else he will not release the mechanics lien on our property which put us in hardship and unable us to sale or refinance the house till now. We are force to rent another place to stay since we did not live on that property for the house was 1932 yrs old and not enough space for my big family. Another questions that keeps bothering me is that: If I decide to get a real estate lawyer and sue him in court because he is doing unlawful acts by doing debt collections, and if the court case is favorable to me and I happen to win the case, and I in return sue him for damages for all the expenses the at I\'ve incurred for this situations, then if he does not want to pay and instead file for bankrupcy, will I be able to attached his personal property or the company that he works for (as the general manager) and get my money back? what are my recourse of actions? What if his company have insurance against litigation and that litigations company will represent him against our case? will this case be drag on and on until I will run out of money paying for my lawyer and we are still fighting this case..I don\'t have much money to spend because I\'m the bread winner of my big family. I would have to borrow money from my credit cards just to be able to pay my lawyer for his $250.00/per hour fee, not to mention the other misc. charges that will be charge to me. Can you please help me by answering all my questions above and instruct me what to do. think of it like -what if you were on my situations now, what will you do in order to resolve this issue ASAP?

								Can an individual broker who is a general manager of the company put a mechanic\'s lien on our primary property because we did not pursue with his construction loan? I was surprised he was able to do so thru County Recorder office in Los Angeles, he claimed that he was our project manager of our property thus was able to get the mechanic\'s lien on us. until now since March 3, 2008, we did not recieve any court summons from him, I know that he has until 90 days to file a case against us, and if he does not do it, I was told that I can demand for the release of the mechanic\'s lien on our property. but the question is: can he re-apply for another  mechanic\'s lien on our property again after I had demanded to have the lien release after the 90 days period? He puts the mechanic\'s lien on our property because he wants me to pay him for his time in securing a construction loan which did not happen because his loan applications interest rate APR is 24% and he did not stand behind his word when he told me before it started that he will get me a construction loan then immediately convert it to permanent loan once the construction is finish in order to avoid double charges, later on, he said that I have to go to escrow twice; one for the construction loan and another for the permanent loan in which he charges 1% on each escrow transaction of the total loan amount. He wanted me to pay him $7,000+ for his 62 hours of work at $150/hour rate or else he will not release the mechanics lien on our property which put us in hardship and unable us to sale or refinance the house till now. We are force to rent another place to stay since we did not live on that property for the house was 1932 yrs old and not enough space for my big family. Another questions that keeps bothering me is that: If I decide to get a real estate lawyer and sue him in court because he is doing unlawful acts by doing debt collections, and if the court case is favorable to me and I happen to win the case, and I in return sue him for damages for all the expenses the at I\'ve incurred for this situations, then if he does not want to pay and instead file for bankrupcy, will I be able to attached his personal property or the company that he works for (as the general manager) and get my money back? what are my recourse of actions?

								We paid $18,000 to have our house sided and have new windows put in. Over the last 3 years we have had so much trouble with the siding staying on and now have lose windows in the house. The company would not reply to our numerous calls and letters. The company now appears to be out of business. The owner seems to be in a neighboring town. Some say we have no rights since the company is out of business. This seems so unfair for us to put that much money into our house and now a couple of years later we have to have it redone. One contractor stated that the nails that were used were too short and that they didn't hit any studs. Parts of my house are now exposed. Any advice on whether I have any rights would be greatly appreciated.

								My husband bought our house in 2002.  It has a gazebo with a jacuzzi in the backyard.  We would like to remove it now for our children but my husband noticed the following in the promissory note the provision for no sale or alteration.  The section reads thus:<br/>
    The Mortgagor may not, without the consent of Mortgagee, (a) alter, demolish or remove the buildings and improvements on the Property, or (b) sell the Property or any part of it.<br/>
<br/>
The bank peviously employeed my husband (it is a small foreign bank working in NYC).  Since he left the bank in 2004, we have had nothing but problems with the bank - they were first under-reporting interst then over-, then they would send amortization tables that didn't make sense - and basically they couldn't get it right.  Recently, my husband reported them to the Federal Reserve Bank and the NYS Banking Dept for these infractions as well as pursued legal action to retrieve money for time spent trying to fix the problem - the arbitrator let my husband know that time spent is not actionable etc.  However at the arbitration, my husband said that he has not received any information from the bank since they stopped taking his calls or answering his emails.  Turns out there is a provision in the Promissory note that states that all communication be done by certified mail.  Now my husband believes that the bank will follow the Promissory note to the letter in everything - but I have a hard time believing that we can't make any changes to the property now or sell it.<br/>
<br/>
So, finally my question is this:<br/>
<br/>
Can we not remove the gazebo or even sell the house at all? (We have been on the market for a while - but that is a differrent story altogether.)

a.	Your team is working as a legal team in a mid-size law firm. Your supervisor, a partner in the firm, has been approached by Mr. Al Jones, a land developer and very important client, with the following legal situation: <br/>
Mr. Jones’s projects include some of the largest residential subdivisions within the City. While Mr. Jones’ business was developing the infrastructure of its newest and largest subdivision, the City discovered an easement for a city utility line on the subdivision that did not belong to Mr. Jones. The owner of the property where the utility easement is located also discovered the error. The City is threatening to close down the subdivision and Mr. Jones’s business, and is threatening to sue Mr. Jones for fraud against a municipality. The adjacent property owner is also threatening to sue the client for damages to his property and for trespassing. The adjacent property owner is a citizen of Switzerland. <br/>
b.	Your supervisor wants your legal team to identify and analyze the client’s legal situation and present to him a confidential presentation that assesses the situation and describes how the law firm can help. The PowerPoint should consist of a minimum of fifteen to twenty slides with appropriate speaker notes. The partner wants your legal team to address each of the following: <br/>
1)	Describe the state and/or federal court(s) that can review and resolve the situation. <br/>
2)	The court(s) that may have jurisdiction over the situation. Explain

								re: Utility Easements: Can a landowner sue a subdivision developer?<br/>
<br/>
Your warranty deed should stipulate, I believe it is called, right of egress, basically easements.<br/>
<br/>
States usually legislate a broad definition. In this state a property may not be sold with less than 100 feet frontage. The exeception is except where access is gained from a municipal public thorougfare.<br/>
<br/>
Public utilities may take an easement on any single boundary. Once an easement is taken, no future easement can disect the property. If an easement is on the frontage, the utility must maintain access for the property. (ex. public sidewalk )<br/>
<br/>
Property owners rights were defined during the advent of the railroad and have been eroded since, on the prinicipal of ""The Public Good"".<br/>
<br/>
Again, your warranty deed should be the definition of what rights others have on your property. The fact you disagree may not be cause for action.

If an employer is asking an employee to ""cost"" man hours (expense time) to a job for which the employee was never present, what should the employee do to protect against any legal ramifications.  The employee has not physically recorded hours to any job that a worker was not present, but is there any concern that the employee would be in legal trouble for not notifying someone that this was asked in the first place?

								I'm not sure this is the right place to post this.  I bought a new 5th wheel RV in Aug 2007. Between Sept &amp; March I have had to have over 35 things repaired.  The manufacture has taken it back to their plant and made the repairs.  It is now April and I have 7 additional repairs to be done.  This Rv has had major problems walls pulling apart, water leaks, ceiling pulling away from wall etc. We ask for the RV to be replaced and was told that would not happen.  I was told by the president of the manufacturing company that this was normal that is why there is a warranty.  Is there anything like a lemon law for RV's? Can anyone help?

								Re: RV PROBLEMS<br/>
<br/>
If it becomes so problematic that you cannot normally use it, you could sue for damages or demand a refund. <br/>
<br/>
But it has to be fairly extreme.

								I entered into a design contract (paid a $750 designer fee up front) for a kitchen/bath remodel. The remodel was not to exceed $20,000 (an additional $5,000 was set aside for unforeseen older home issues). The $750 would have eventually been used towards the project costs. <br/>
<br/>
The first design meeting had the budget at approx. $35,000 and after repeated meetings the designer was only able to reduce the budget to $28,000. I decided to stop working with the company as it appeared they would not be able to work within my budget constraints. I received an email from the designer saying my budget was ""unrealistic"" and good luck finding a designer who would be willing to take on my project much less be able to complete it within my budget. <br/>
<br/>
Does this admission make the contract invalid? Do I have a case to request a partial or full refund of the design fee?  If the contract is invalid, what is the legal argument I have against the company and their contract?

								re: Invalid Design Contract?<br/>
<br/>
Yo could seek a refund if all sides had agreed that the initial max amount was 20,000.<br/>
<br/>
If they could not consult for you within that budget then they should not have taken the fee.

								My fiance and I are in the process of buying a home. We are buying a home from a place called Excel Homes. They make modular houses. There has been a bunch of crap that has happened since we started this process. First of all, we started all of this in October of last year. We contacted Excel Homes and they said that we had to go through a real estate associate to order one of their homes. They listed a ReMax affiliate. We called this person (we'll call him ""Jeff"") and started talking about what we wanted. We chose a floor plan called the Keystone but we made some changes to it. One of the first problems we encountered is that ""Jeff"" never had any of the paperwork done right the first time. We would show up and sign papers and then later in the week we would receive a phone call that he forgot this paper or that paper and we had to meet him and sign it. Then he wanted a $2000 good faith check made out to him...which thank god I made sure we didn't pay. We told them that we would pay for the septic system, the excavation, and the driveway. Next, they put stone on our driveway after we told them not to. (Subsequently, all the stone got lost in the mud) Now, they want us to pay them for that. Somehow, in the course of the mortgage agreement (which also took weeks because our original mortgage officer got fired) it shows us owing $7,500+ dollars for the foundation and $5,000 dollars for the well. We are getting a geothermal heating/cooling system put in and it uses two wells. One for the heating/cooling and one for the excess water. The excess water tank is also supposed to be our main water well. Since, we are already paying for the geothermal system then we shouldn't have to pay an additional $5,000 for the main water well. The latest problem is that Excel Homes mysteriously forgot to put in a way to hook up the heating and cooling vents inside the home so, the subcontractors decided they want to build this hideous 14"" box coming into the kitchen. It will go up through the floor to the second floor and take over closet space upstairs. The subcontractors claim that someone from Excel came out to look at it and agreed with them but I'm not so sure. I can't get anyone at Excel to return my calls.  Please HELP!!!!!! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Sorry I'm so long winded but, you really need all those details.

Based on what you say here, you could file suit against them (or at least threaten to do so) in small claims court or in regular court; filing in small claims court is easier and requires no attorney...you could try to collect all of the costs and damages that you suffered due to their behavior... You may also report them to your state attorney general's office.

								I am trying to find a court ruling on this issue.  <br/>
<br/>
Property owner #1 filed plans and received a permit to construct a community facility mixed with professional offices and has approved plans and permits which the zoning allows for a 3-4 story building plus 30 feet below street level for a basement and sub-basement.  I am property owner #2 of an adjacent vacant lot, hoping one day to construct a 3 story residential dwelling with a foundation that would go no more than 3 - 4 feet below street level which is normal in this Brooklyn, NY neighborhood.  As per engineers, because property #1 is excavating 30 feet below street level, I must follow the 30 foot foundation of property #1 with a 30 foot foundation on my property.  The cost estimated is between $150,000-$200,000 additional for the excavation and foundation.  Additionally, my property is adjacent to property #3 which has a house that I will be required to underpin 30 feet to match up to the depth.  This is at an enormous cost which I am now waiting to receive an estimate.  <br/>
<br/>
My question is, where would I find a court ruling of a similar case which I can show to the property #1 owner to try to arbitrate a peaceful settlement to avoid the enormous amounts of legal expenses.  <br/>
<br/>
Your help is very greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you once again.

								I am in California,<br/>
<br/>
Here is my story in a nut shell ..<br/>
<br/>
In the beginning of 2006 we contracted a house to be built ..<br/>
Foundation went up in May 2006 .. <br/>
We received a 20 Prelim June 19th 2006<br/>
We gave the first Draw per the contract when the Sub Floor was complete.<br/>
-The Contractor pointed out a place in the contract that he could ask for additional funds up front (which we know now was a BS contract)<br/>
We gave him a Second draw ..<br/>
Things we going along ok till June 2006 then nothing. <br/>
-We thought we might have a Problem SO WE WENT to the Material Provider and asked to see the books. They said NO because they didn’t have a Contract with us. We made it clear that the contractor had been paid and was to be on a CASH Only Account.<br/>
Things went along slowly .. We asked the contractor for releases and couldn’t get them from him SO WE WENT Back to the Material Provider who again Refused to open the books but insisted there was no Problems.<br/>
This went on for 6 more months .. We have 38 Phone calls logged to the Material Provider and 3 or 4 Visits .. ALL asking for the account info because we needed to show Diversion of Funds to Legal fire the Contractor.<br/>
In Dec 2006 we had a Lawyer Call the Provider and they still refused to give the info.<br/>
IN Jan 2007 the Provider Finally came to us and told us there was a HUGH Problem after we told them we where Firing the Contractor for Breech of Contract.<br/>
Here is the Kicker ..<br/>
Seems the whole time they said the account was OK they where lying. The Contractor by there own books had only paid $10,000 on my account with another $30,000 going to Old accounts before he even started my project. The contractor was 180days Late and $30,000 in the hole when the Same Material Provider gave him credit to start my house unknowing to myself.<br/>
I got all there paperwork and compared it to the 850+ Photos I had durihng the 6 months and told the that there was $29,000 out of the $53,000 they claimed to be mine that actually was consumed into my project.<br/>
They LIENED my for the whole $53,000 with no Verification that the materials where consumed in my project.<br/>
Of course now we have a Lawyer ..<br/>
We have been back in forth for several Months now and they have taken off around $11,000 in Materials that I have always claimed that where not mine, BUT they are saying the $11,000 that I speak of was never in the Lien. ....<br/>
The Material Providers Lawyer is also trying to say that I never told them to run the contractor cash only for Materials .. and the 38 Phone calls where for other reasons ..<br/>
I know I should have put in a written stop notice but at the time I had no Idea I needed to.<br/>
I know much about Lien Laws now, more then I ever wanted to but I need Help now ..<br/>
<br/>
Is the 20 Prelim considered a Contract?<br/>
Is the Material Provider Morally Obligated to Inform me about Stop Noticed?<br/>
If the Material Provider went against there own credit policies are they responsible for the account?<br/>
<br/>
In my Mind because they wouldn’t give me the information I needed and where the Only ones who had that information to legally fire the contractor before he ran up an account basically unchecked for 6 months to over $100,000 Half of which they claim was mine, I feel they are Negligent to the point where it is criminal.<br/>
<br/>
Btw . The Contractor was Ordering Massive amounts of lumber under my Name and diverting it mid-shipment to other properties.<br/>
<br/>
Also we have Delivery Slips that have been altered after the Lien was filed. Things like Signatures when None where present before .. Most of them you cant read .. <br/>
<br/>
The Material Provider also had ALL the Contractors projects LUMPED into 1 folder with no real accounting of who was responsible for what. They basically Liened me for whatever they couldn’t account for on the contractors account.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you VERY Much for you time,<br/>

								My boyfriend is not licensed and the people knew that when hiring him to finish their basement. They had a contract set up with phases of work. The homeowners kept forcing him to start a new phase before an older one was complete. He was leaving his tools at the job so he would not have to transport them back and forth which was fine with the homeowners. He left one night to return the next day and the homeowner called him that night and told him not to return. He requested to come and retrieve his tools, they kept  telling him NO. He has called the local police department to see if they would help and they told him that its up to the officer on scene whether the officer will enforce them to return the tools or not. Now he has received a letter from the homeowner stating that if he does not give them a list of items they came up with that they would liquidate his tools. The list they gave him does not comply with the contract. The contract is not itemized as far as what items are needed to complete the phases.  Can they do that? How can he get his tools back? They have a new contractor finishing the job who is also not licensed nor have they had any of the electrical and plumbing inspected. They are doing all this under the radar.<br/>
<br/>
By the way this has all taken place in Maryland.<br/>

Thank you for any advise of information.

								My boyfriend is not licensed and the people knew that when hiring him to finish their basement. They had a contract set up with phases of work. The homeowners kept forcing him to start a new phase before an older one was complete. He was leaving his tools at the job so he would not have to transport them back and forth which was fine with the homeowners. He left one night to return the next day and the homeowner called him that night and told him not to return. He requested to come and retrieve his tools, they kept  telling him NO. He has called the local police department to see if they would help and they told him that its up to the officer on scene whether the officer will enforce them to return the tools or not. Now he has received a letter from the homeowner stating that if he does not give them a list of items they came up with that they would liquidate his tools. The list they gave him does not comply with the contract. The contract is not itemized as far as what items are needed to complete the phases.  Can they do that? How can he get his tools back?

								Any advice on how to respond to the city code enforcement person because the fence on the side yard of a corner lot is too tall?  All corner lots have high side yard fences in the neighborhood.  I sent the city a couple dozen nearby addresses and photos, but they simply cite the code and say to lower the height.<br/>
<br/>
The fence is a replacement of a same height dilapidated fence.  Currently it only has posts and the top rail.  So technically there is no fence since the definition of fence states that a fence is a barrier.  <br/>
<br/>
The enforcement is unfair since hundreds of nearby corner lots have the same configuration.<br/>
<br/>
Advice?<br/>

								My mom entered into a contract to have her original 8'x16' screen room turned into a 16'x16' enclosed acrylic window room.  She signed the contract on May 20th and gave the demanded 50% down payment of $9,100.<br/>
<br/>
Jerry, the person that she dealt with was listed as the company's field supervisor and the owner/licensed certified residential contract was listed as Ken.<br/>
<br/>
Time continued to go on and Jerry kept telling her that the delay in getting started was due to the building department.  We later wound out, by looking at the blueprints and attached paperwork that the drawings were not even faxed over to the engineering company until 7/20.  They were actually faxed over by Jeff, a contractor from a different company that he paid to draw them up.  The engineering company completed and certified the blueprints on 7/31.  Jerry then finally applied for the permit on 8/16 and it was approved on 9/5.<br/>
<br/>
Jerry sent a person named Paul and his crew out to do the job.  The first thing that they did wrong was to actually pour the add on slab 9'x17' instead of the 8'x16'.  They then continued to build the structure and it just did not look right and it took so many calls to Jerry to get him to come out.  He did not understand why we were demanding for him to come out, since the building inspector already approved it.  <br/>
<br/>
When he came out, he was rude and not polite at all.  That was until I pulled out the blueprints.  He did not know how to read them, so I had to show him how the blueprints are for a hip roof and they built a gable roof.  The work was even very poorly done.<br/>
<br/>
They then had to take most of it down to change it over to the hip roof.  The work was so bad and I had to keep showing Paul how the work was not done properly.  I was not being nit picky.  Beams that were to be joined by receiving joints were not and there was up to a half of inch space in-between them and you could see the screws just out there in the open.  He finally walked off.<br/>
<br/>
Jerry then paid Jeff, the contractor from the other company, to come out and look at the work.  Jeff told him that it was all built wrong and had to all come down and be rebuilt.  Jerry paid Jeff $1,000.00 a day for 3 days to take down everything that was wrong and to get it back started right.<br/>
<br/>
Well the composite roof panels that were taken down off the roof ended up disappearing and they substituted them for plain composite ceiling panels that are not even put up and cut correctly.<br/>
<br/>
They ended up dropping off the acrylic windows that were custom made, but they were not what was agreed upon and written in the contract.  They windows were to be 8' with not spreader bar.  The company had notified all of their customers back in Feb that they are no longer backing them and would only make them with a 2"" spreader bar 3' up from the bottom.  The acrylic window company still shows those windows on their website as 8' with no spreader bar.  So actually, the contract was fraudulent, because Jerry knew months before the signing of the contract that the windows that she wanted and paid for were no longer available.<br/>
<br/>
They wanted to install the windows before they even came close to completing the roof or work that had to be done inside, but mom refused to allow the windows to go in, because they are not what the ordered.<br/>
<br/>
My mom refused to let them take the windows back, because she did not feel that the work that was done was worth the $9,100 that she paid them seven months prior.  Jerry's assistant or whatever kept calling my mom every five minutes yelling at her and telling her that they are calling the police and sending them right over to arrest her.  The police of course never showed up and later she called back to say that they went to the building department and put a stop work order on all work on mom's property and that their attorney will handle the matter from then on.  Therefore, they actually walked off the job.<br/>
<br/>
Even before this, Jerry would use four letter words at my mom over the phone and would always try to intimidate her.<br/>
<br/>
We have now done our homework and Jerry has five cist and deist orders for being unlicensed between July and October of last year and under two different names.  The county building department is still telling us that he is working legally under someone else’s license, because anyone with a license can just let anyone they want to use their license and not have to be involved at all.  The State Investigator has told me that that is a bunch of bull.<br/>
<br/>
Now finally after that long intro to the problem, here is where we are now.  We have had three other contractors come out to give a quote on how much it would cost to have finished.  They all have said that the workmanship is so poor and would not meet code that the whole thing needs to be taken down and all started over.  I believe this, but to be on the safe side, we are having a nonbiased inspector who is a general contractor, a certified residential contractor, and a licensed roofing contractor, to come out and give a professional report of the condition of what we were left with.<br/>
<br/>
We also found out today that the concrete was not put in right and is now sinking and tipping up and the only thing that can be done is to take it all out and redo it all.  Before this started, I was in the process of polishing the concrete to give her a nice polished floor.  I spent around $1,500 on diamond grinding pads and many hours to get it to look nice.  Now if it has to be all taken out, I will have to start all over and probably spend around another $1,500 on a new set of grinding pads.  Can we sue the contractor for this expense?<br/>
<br/>
I was also in the process of putting in a 32'x12' pond with a large waterfall and completely landscaping the rest of the yard around it.  I have not been able to do the work, because with the structure having to be taken down so many times, there is so much aluminum and other debris all over the yard.  It really looks like a junk yard.<br/>
<br/>
All of this has caused my mom a lot of stress and depression.  Can she sue for what she has suffered, because of all of this?<br/>
<br/>
She has also not been able to use her old screen room or new acrylic window room for 8 months.  Can she sue for the lose of use of the room and yard?<br/>
<br/>
Why I am asking all of this is because we are putting a report together to submit to the company's owner/licensee, who we have never meet, spoke to, or been able to get him to return a call, with an amount that we will settle for to keep us from filing our report to the State, because he will be the person that is ultimately responsible and will face the chance of being charged all of the fines and take the chance of losing his license and livelihood.<br/>
<br/>
What we are looking at right now is to be paid back the complete deposit, pay to have the concrete removed and replaced, and all of the damages that where made to the house.  We do not want to be greedy, because we really are hoping to be able to settle with him, but want to be reimbursed for what she is untitled too.<br/>
<br/>
If you have gotten this far, please let, let me know all that we would be untitled to sue for.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

								I own a condo on the top floor (12th) of a condo complex. There is an association with a board which has hired a management company to run the business affairs of the condo building including maintenance. I am responsible for a maintenance fee every month paid to the management company.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past 2 years I have had repeated roof leaks from the same spot. I've called the condo management company on the matter each time. Always they claim someone is sent out to fix the problem. However the problem continues. Now I am in the process of renovating my kitchen (where leaking roof problem is located) so that I can sell the condo. However, I am afraid that the continued problem could damage the cabinets, ceramic tiling, and appliances that I am installing, both ruining them and hurting my chances of selling the condo.<br/>
<br/>
Someone suggested that I go to the courts where I can get my condo maintenance fees paid to the courts, which would withhold those fees from the condo management company until the problems is solved. Is this true? What are my other options? What are my options if another roof leak problem does ultimately ruin my property or damage my ability to sell the condo?

I would suggest having an expert installer and builder review the past problems and adjust whatever is needed to ensure no damage--not a legal answer but a construction answer. They may need to account for the issue one way or another.

Based on what you say here, you could file suit against them (or at least threaten to do so) in small claims court or in regular court; filing in small claims court is easier and requires no attorney...you could try to collect all of the costs and damages that you suffered due to their behavior... You may also report them to your state attorney general's office.

								We signed a contract to have our house be painted with tex-cote. The contract states lifetime warranty on material and labor.  Material warranty be issued by Textured Coating of America.  Labor warranty is issued by the contracting company.  There was a verbal agreement that the project would take 7 to 10 days, although on their contract it says they have 90 days to complete.  The project started on 9/19/06 and the paint job was completed on 11/01/06.  Although the paint job was completed they did not clean up around the house.  I was completely dissatisfied with the finished work.  The coating of the house is uneven, there are paints on our roof tiles, on our plants and trees around the house, the paint and tex cote are not evenly lined around the window and door framings.  We've mentioned our concerns to the crew, the general manager and the owner.  They offerred minor compensation and agreed to do minor clean up on the lawn.  As a gesture of good faith, we agreed to pay half of the balance and the other half will depend on how much and how well they clean up.  <br/>
<br/>
By law, do I have the right to hold payment until I am 100% satisfied of their job performance.  Can I request for more compensation or deduct out of the balance of any clean up that they refuse to do?  The contract states lifetime warranty on labor.  I spoke to the owner and he said that their representative, at the time, made a mistake.  Their warranty on labor is only 10 years.  Is the contract binding since he refuses to issue a warranty certificate that states 'Lifetime'?  Can I hold the company responsible should anything happen to the house after 10 years?

								Re: Unsatisfactory contracting job<br/>
<br/>
Would be interested in reading follow up from homeowner. Likely there will be problems like my house where Tex-cote failed in 6-9 years in patches.  How do you get the remaining stuff off so you can refinish?  The painting contractor will likely be long gone, or claim a hurricane or acid rain or ?? caused the failure and possibly try to do slapdash repair job.  Tex-Cote may supply more product, but painting is 70-80% labor.  Bottom line: What sounds like a ""Lifetime Solution"" may instead be a ""lifetime problem.""

You can hold back partial payment, or pay and file in small claims for a refund due to delay, poor quality etc.

Would be interested in reading follow up from homeowner. Likely there will be problems like my house where Tex-cote failed in 6-9 years in patches.  How do you get the remaining stuff off so you can refinish?  The painting contractor will likely be long gone, or claim a hurricane or acid rain or ?? caused the failure and possibly try to do slapdash repair job.  Tex-Cote may supply more product, but painting is 70-80% labor.  Bottom line: What sounds like a ""Lifetime Solution"" may instead be a ""lifetime problem.""

								15 months ago I signed a contract with a surveyor to turn three properties into two. 3 months later he came out to measure. Since then nothing.<br/>
The contract has no end date but there is a clause about doing the job professionally and in a timely manner.The deal was 900.00 down and 900.00<br/>
when done. I called him recently and told him to just survey my land for the 900.00 I gave him and forget the rest. He said ok and again I have heard nothing from him.Over the 15 months I called him 30 times with no replys.<br/>
Has enough time gone buy to void this contract and get my 900.00 back in small claims court. If I sue him can he counter sue for breach of contract.<br/>

After one year of little or no work I asked him to forget the subdivision<br/>

   The first agreement was a written contract the second was oral.<br/>
do I have to wait one year before I can sue him in small claims court on the oral contract. We did not agree on an end date.

								Earlier this year some tenants of mine moved out of our rental.  We began to do small jobs in the home after they moved out.  Shortly after this, we tried selling the home and unfortunately were not able to.  The home was vacant for 6 months until it was taken off of the market and I decided to have new tenants move in.  They have been there for almost 2 months now.  Yesterday I recieve a phone call from someone who works at the County Environmental Agency telling me that there is a criminal investigation going on because they had found some illegal trash (paint,oil,tires) that was dumped along with some mail which had my previous tenants names and the address of my rental home.  The current tenants told me that the police dept. had spoken to them threatening them with a felony and interviewed some of the neighbors.  I don't understand what's going on.  Does this affect me in any way?  We had done some work on the house 6 months ago but everything was disposed of PROPERLY.

It should not. The illegal dumping of trash done by tenants is not your responsibility. We assume you did not do it as well.

								Re: illegal trash and dumping<br/>
<br/>
It sounds as if your former tenants had engaged in illegal dumping in a restricted area.  Call the police department back and fully cooperate with them in any way.  Chances are you will not be held liable for the actions of your ex-tenants (especially if you are cooperative and are concerned about violations of the law).  Let the police know these people (whose name is on the mail) were your tenants &amp; when they moved out.  Give them the forwarding address they left you.  Let them know that your new tenants didn't move in until many months after the old ones left, as the house had been empty and on the market for sale in between.  They have no knowledge of the old tenants.  <br/>
<br/>
The paint is probably not latex interior paint (like you would have used) but some type of oil based or enamel paint (maybe from painting cars).  Did these tenants work on vehicles a lot?  Tires, oil, &amp; paint sound like someone that was working on his car and dumped the bad tires and oil, along with any leftover paint from painting the car, alongside some road.  Call the police and tell them all you know about the ex-tenants.  Give them your number to call you with any further questions they have.

								re: Wife's siblings wants to place leans on the property<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, my husband took his Ambien already when he wrote this and therefore are many mispelled words...sorry! The problem is my father moved in with us about 5 years ago after my mother died because of health problems.  He was going to buy a new home near me but we decided it was best if we build an addition onto our home so I could watch over him.  I have been taking care of my father since with no help from my sisters or brothers.  Recently, my father was taken to the hospital and now he is in a sub-acute nursing home for therapy.  My father gives me money every month for expenses such as food, gas &amp; electric, cable, phone, etc and my oldest sister is not happy about that.  She was made power of attorney when my mother was still alive only because she was the oldest of 6 children.  She made mention during an argument that I am the one who will benefit from the addition put on my house and to be perfectly honest, the neighborhood I live in I will be lucky to get what we deserve out of the property.  She mentioned that she wasnt the only one in the family who made that comment.  My god, I am the one who took my father in, cares for him, cleans up urine etc....do I have to worry that my siblings will come after my home in any way when my father passes?  Do they have any legal right?  The house is in my husbands name, nothing is in my father's name.  Should I get papers done and signed by my father while he still can stating that they have no interest whatsoever in my home.  What should I do?  Thank you.

After I filled out the paperwork I was told that since my ex husband's name is on the mortgage he has to be present to sign off on the forms. The problem is is that my current husband of 25 years and myself have lived in the house and I do not know where my ex husband is even located.

								My question concerns our renovation project on our 80 year old house that resulted in our house falling off the blocks.  This first task in our project was to raise the foundation.  Our general contractor hired Foundation Company.  Less than a week of work into the foundation, something, still to be determined, happened, which resulted in our house falling about 16 inches and sliding about 2 feet over.  The house suffered internal and external damages.  <br/>
<br/>
We are working through our insurance company and their independent adjuster.  At the onset, there seemed to be no question that we would have coverage and the insurance company would be reimbursed through subrogation.  Now, two months later, and the house still uninhabitable, there has been a change in tone from the adjuster.  Not to mention the insurance company has not had any formal communication with us.  The adjuster's tone has changed from one of confidence that we will have no issues with coverage for repairs and damages to one of keeping repair costs down, as if our insurance company has no hope of recovering through subrogation.  <br/>
<br/>
Can you recommend a ""type"" of lawyer to contact and also can you give me your impressions of my situation (i.e., are we on the losing end of this situation and should I start bankruptcy proceedings)?  This is truly unnerving as we have not received a formal commitment of coverage from our insurance company, and the insurance company for Foundation Company have stated, verbally, they will not pay for the damages to our house.  <br/>
<br/>
Your advice is appreciated........don't want to lose faith in ""the system"", but seems like all parties involved are trying to deny responsibility.  Thanks!

								My husband and I live in Durham, NC and in 2002 got a permit in order to add on to the side of our existing house. Once we received it we dug the footing.  Then they came and inspected it and signed off on it. The next step for us was to pour the footing which we were a little slow getting to due to money. ( Mainly because we were doing the work ourselves). Once the footing was poured, the inspectors came out and again signed off on the permit.  Now, initially when we got the permit the zoning requirement said that we had to be 25 ft. from the street which we were.  Now a few years later when we got the money to continue with our project we poured the foundation, added the two rooms on the side, and another larger one above it.  The mistake we made was not updating our permit because once we added those rooms and put the roof on an inspector drove by and asked to see our permit.  My husband showed it to him and he said that all we needed to do was to go down and get it updated. Two days later when we were ready to go get it renewed we received a stop work order because we didn't have an updated permit.  We were also told by the same inspector that we had to take the side structure down because the zoning ordinance had been changed since we got our initial permit, and that we could not be more than 15ft. from the street.  They then told us that we could try and apply for a variance at the tune of $750.00 but would not be assured of getting one.  My husband went downtown and spoke with someone in charge and he said yes the zoning ordinance had been changed since we received our permit and that if we didn't apply for the variance we'd have to take everything down. A day after he spoke with that person everyone in the neighborhood (including us) received a letter stating that the town was going to get ready to pave the road (which is a dirt road) on the side where our new structure exists. <br/>
My husband and I put a lot of time and money into building those rooms to the side of our home and we know that we should have gotten our permit renewed, but is it lawful for them to change the zoning ordinances without notifiying us first?  Do we have to take it down?  We have seven children and can't afford to move or pay money for a variance only for them to tell us no we can't get it.  Now we have the room we need, but we can't live in them.  Please help!!!!!!!!!<br/>

If you had already laid the foundation you could object or even go to court. That part was approved and cannot be easily changed. Tell them you will ask a judge if they cannot compromise.

Thank you for your advice.  The only problem we have is that, the footing was dug and poured, and both were signed off on the permit.  We had no earthly idea that they could change their minds whenever they please.  Please let me know if we have any recourse or other options available to us.  The work is impeccable and we are in dire need of the room.  Please help!<br/>

Normally if they agreed you can sue if need be for the costs if they then change, or ask a court to prevent the change.

								Building a house and the builder was suppose to do an  did energy wise home  but said the Township  would not approve the plans now we find that the township did not deny the plans  he did in fact bankrupt the company and could not get the materials to do that type of home, we did not know this until this week and the house is pr sa complete.  He in turn told us we would have to convert to a home wood home so we did but he only cut the price by $12,000 and of course keeps adding thing so that we are to the original price. By the time all this happened we had already given them a bunch of money and could not change builders.  If he would  have told us this I would have gone with another builder which was $45,000  less.<br/>
<br/>
Do we have any recourse against him?  He is over the time limit of the contract at this point and the house is still not done. We have a 180  day clause in the contract.<br/>
<br/>
Any help you can give me I would appreciate.<br/>

Based on what you say here, you could file suit against them (or at least threaten to do so) in small claims court or in regular court; filing in small claims court is easier and requires no attorney but amounts are limited...you could try to collect all of the costs and damages that you suffered due to their behavior...

								Hello,<br/>
    thanks in advance for any help/advice. <br/>
Almost 9 months ago my brother introduced me to a carpenter/handyman thats had already built 3 houses, and he was looking for someone to close a deal he found. It was a house that appraised at $175,000.00 that I agreed to buy for $160.000.00, AFTER that I,my brother and this carpenter reached an agreement where I was the one to put the money in, and the 2 of them had to renovate the house. At the end of the renovation the house would have appraised at around $230,000.00 (it's an estimate based on the values of surrounding area).<br/>
My out of pocket expenses would have been $15/20K for the material needed for the renovation, plus I had to pay for the mortgage until the house would have been sold. We reached an agreement where the profit after all the expenses would have to be split in a 40/40/20%, where I was the one to get the 20%, and both my brother and this third guy would get 40% each. <br/>
They estimated that it would have taken 45/60 days to complete the job. It was mid August 2006 when we reached this agreement with a HANDSHAKE. To make a long story short, it was October 22 when I was asked $7,000.00  to buy new windows and doors, which they installed, but since then nothing else has been done, the interior has been stripped down, and the house looks terrible. I've been trying to reach this carpenter in any way without any luck, and my brother tells me that he cannot do his job (tiles, bathrooms) if the other guy does not do his job first. I tried to hire a different contractor also, but 4 of them refused to even give me an estimate after looking at the house,<br/>
so, right now I'm holding a piece of almost worthless property, when in the first place I bought something under 15k of appraised value, and the worst thing is that I've been paying an interest only mortgage  for the past 8 months  (I thought that the house would sell in 3 or 4 months).<br/>
What can I do? Is a VERBAL agreement good enough to sue this guy? <br/>
Thanks again for any advice.<br/>

								My mother is an Alzheimer's sufferer and my father can no longer care for her himself.  He wants to move down to Texas to live with me and my wife for help and support caring for her.  <br/>
<br/>
I own 5.5 acres outside of city limits and the county I live in does not have deed restrictions as to what I do on my property, building-wise.  Me, my wife, and parents discussed them building a small house on my land, but we decided it would be too cumbersome if we ever wanted to sell the property.   I would have two separate domiciles to sell.  <br/>
<br/>
Instead, my dad is financing a $140,000 addition to my home for he and my mother to live in.  My daughter-in-law works for a title company and she says that she believes that besides the increase in property value creating a hike in property and school tax, there will be an additional tax liability.  <br/>
<br/>
She says the county and federal tax authorities will look at this addition to my house as a gift and hit us with a gift tax.  It is not a gift.  My parents are building this addition to my house to live in, for however much longer they have to live (hopefully a long time).  <br/>
<br/>
I need to know if I will incur any additional tax liability besides an increase in property tax, which we have already factored in and my father will be paying the increase.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice or information anyone might have would be most appreciated.<br/>

get an accountant or tax specialist to help you structure this so that you don't pay taxes on this--there are many ways it could be structured depending on your finances--the cost should be a few hundred dollars or so and would be well worth it
